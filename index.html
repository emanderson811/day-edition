<h2> Welcome to the Day Edition</h2>
<p>
In 1980, H. Summerfield Day, the former University Architect (1966-1975) and Planning Coordinator (1975-1980), completed the history of Iowa State University's buildings and grounds. This massive undertaking took him and his assistants twelve years to complete. The book contains information on virtually every building or structure that had been built on the Iowa State University campus prior to 1979.
</p>
<p>This digital edition of Day's book is a project of the Iowa State University Library Digital Scholarship and Initiatives department. It aims to make this important historical resource more accessible to the public, while also providing annotations and links to additional resources to enhance understanding of the text.</p>
