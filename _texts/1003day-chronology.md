{:toc}

The following list is not complete since a number of minor structures of relative unimportance have been omitted. Date started is that of the year in which a contract was awarded and construction begun. Date of occupancy and use may vary from the year shown to two or more years later. "Year gone" is that of the year in which the building was razed, burned, moved, or otherwise gone from its site.

Valuations shown are those included in the 1979 Financial Report or, for buildings no longer existing, the last reported figure of value. Where * is shown in valuation column it indicates title to building is not in the name of the University and it is not listed in the FinanÂ­cial Report for the University.

The building name used is the name currently applied to the structure. Earlier names are identified under each building in section on Campus Buildings, and in the Index.
