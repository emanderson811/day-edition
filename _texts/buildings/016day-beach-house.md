Ellen H. Richards Home Management House (1926-1952) 
Built: 1905-06 Contractor: W.J. Gordon Razed: 1961 
Located in area between what is now Gilman Hall and Spedding

This house was built for the head of the Horticulture department, Prof. S.A. Beach at a cost of $5500. He lived there until his death 
in 1922. 
In 1923 the house was repaired and remodeled to adapt it to use as a Practice Cottage, at a cost of $2600. This was one of four such houses called by that name or Student Management Houses at that period. 
The house continued as the Ellen H. Richards Home Management House until 1952. In 1956 it was being used for storage by WOI-TV. In 1960 the basement was being used as a work area for geology students in a rock collection project. The building was razed the following year.
