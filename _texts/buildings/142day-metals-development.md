The Atomic Energy Commission proposed this building in 1951 and re quested that land b~ leased for the site.(1) However, it was April of 1959 before a lease was executed.(2) Bids were taken in June by the A.E.C. (3) 
Bids for equipment items --an extrusion press, rolling mill, labora 
tory equipment and elevator --and for the storm sewer extension, were 
taken by the university under separate contracts, although all costs were reimbursed by the Atomic Energy Commission. 
A machine shop addition on the north side of the building was constrcted in 1966-67. (4)
