The Atomic Energy Commission proposed this building in 1951 and requested that land be leased for the site.[^fn1] However, it was April of 1959 before a lease was executed.[^fn2] Bids were taken in June by the A.E.C. [^fn3] 

Bids for equipment items -- an extrusion press, rolling mill, laboratory equipment and elevator -- and for the storm sewer extension, were taken by the university under separate contracts, although all costs were reimbursed by the Atomic Energy Commission. 

A machine shop addition on the north side of the building was constructed in 1966-67. [^fn4]
