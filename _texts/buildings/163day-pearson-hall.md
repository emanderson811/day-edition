Even before an appropriation was made for the Classroom Building its site was under discussion. In 1956 it was reported that it "would be located west of Morrill Hall between Beardshear Hall and the Library."[^fn1] By 1959, when the funds were made available, the final decision on location had not been reached but it was thought it would be "either north or south of Marston Hall." [^fn2] 

Design of the building started in 1959 and the construction contracts were awarded in October 1960.[^fn3] This was the first campus building to incorporate television viewing equipment as a feature for instructional use, and to provide special "language laboratories". An area for campus-wide data processing was provided in the ground floor area. 

The building was completed and in use in June 1962.[^fn4] 

In 1964 the name, Pearson Hall was assigned to the building in recognition of one-time President Raymond Allen Pearson. 

It has provided office space for the departments of English, Foreign Languages, and for Media Resources in recent years.
