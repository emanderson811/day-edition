Built: 1870 Razed: 1900 
Located where Landscape Architecture stands now. 
The need for a stable was first expressed at the January 1868 meeting of the Trustees. In May the Executive Committee was instructed to "procure plans for the proposed farm building and make the locaticn for the same." (1) 
Steps were taken the following year to acquire materials but the pro ject was abandoned until t870. No contract for construction is re corded. It is probable that the work was accomplished using farm and student labor. 
The building is described in the 4th Biennial Report (1870-71): 
The hourse barn, likewise of brick 30 x 40 feet, and provided with suitable stalls, loft, harness-room, and granary, was put up with an appropriation granted by the legislature of 1868. The construction and fitting up of a basement made the aggregate expense of one hundred and fifteen dollars and twenty-five cents more than the sum appropriated, which was two thousand five hundred dollars. This excess was paid by the transfer, made according to a law of 1868, of a part of the amount saved in the building of a hen-house and a corn crib. 
This barn served well enough for a quarter of a century, but in 1897 funds were requested for larger quarters. 
In 1900 the old horse barn was razed to be replaced by a new barn.
