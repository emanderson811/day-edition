Built: 1912 Designed and built: Thomas Sloss Sold and moved: 1966 
This house was located at what is today the southeast corner of the East Hall addition. Late in 1911 the Board authorized $1500 for erection of a iive or six room house for the farm herdsman.(1) Work was not started until the following spring when Supt. Sloss was "orderecl to wreck the old veterinary barns, and to commence work on the herdsman's house." (2) 
In 1915 the Board authorized the removal of the house to a site op posite the Power Plant and appropriated $150 for that purpose. No explanation has been found of why the house was not moved, but it remained at its original site until 1966 when it was sold and moved 
to Gilbert, to make room for the East Hall Addition. 
George Edwards, Herdsman, lived in the house from 1925 until 1965.
