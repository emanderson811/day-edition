This building was conceived as a "Storage Building for Buildings and Grounds Department" at the time the construction contract was awarded in September 1924, in the amount of $6,537. 
In 1928 the record shows an increased value of $10,500 and thirty years later $11,746.72, and retained that value until it was razed to make room for the new building.
