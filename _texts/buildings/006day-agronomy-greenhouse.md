Ickes-Brown Greenhouse Mfg. Co. (1950) 
The proposed new greenhouse for the Agronomy Department was described in the November 15, 19~0 issue of the Iowa State Daily Student: 
The greenhouse, which will consist of two greenhouse units and a head house, will be located in the area north of the Collegiate Press Building and west of Central Stores. The 20-year plan of Iowa State calls for the later addition of a third greenhouse unit and construction of an Agronomy Building west of the new greenhouse. 
The greenhouse units, 100 by 33 feet in size, will feature over head heating, the latest inovation in greenhouse temperature con trol. ... 
The head house, 120 by 24 feet, will connect the two greenhouse units and will contain a freezing chamber for study of winter hardiness and frost resistance of seeds .... 
On December 3 the paper reported that ground had been broken for construc tion of the greenhouse. At the September 16, 1941, Board meeting Presi dent Friley reported that the greenhouse project had been completed. 
The contract for the third greenhouse wing was awarded in March 1950. Work was accepted as complete in June 1951. 
A fire in January 1953 resulted in a $2650 loss to the building and equipment.
