Built: 1966-67 Architect: Brown, Healey & Bock Contractor: Carlson-Rockey, Inc. 
At the Board meeting of December 9-10, 1954, "President Hilton re ported that people interested in the Short Course for Firemen at the Iowa State College have indicated a desire to construct a building on the campus which would provide needed facilities for the short course. It was the consensus that the Board's attitude would be fa vorable toward such a project."(1) 
On May 26, 1956, the Iowa State Daily reported that "A project involv ing the erection of a $350,000 building on the Iowa State campus for a firemanship training and engineering extension continuation center was proposed at the Firemanship Training School here this week." By December 4 of that year the concept had grown larger as shown in the Daily's story of that date: 
The Iowa Fire Chiefs Association plans to ask the 1957 legislature for a $250,000 appropriation to aid in building a $500,000 Civil ian Defense and Firemanship Training Center at Iowa State. 
Civilian defense officials said that the Federal Civil Defense Administration would supply the other $250,000 for the center. 
Iowa State officials approved the plan and agreed to assume re sponsibility for maintenance if the funds are made available. The proposed center would contain a 500-seat auditorium suitable for conversion into an emergency hospital, a 100-seat classroom, four 60-seat classrooms and an equipment display room. 
The center would also have a fire and materials testing laboratory, a paved training yard for rescue work and fire fighting apparatus and a fire station for Iowa State. Civil defense structure such as bomb shelter would be included. A fire training tower would be at the rear of the building. 
Those elaborate plans remained d.ormant for almost nine years, until a state appropriation of $150,000 for the building was made by the

legislature in the spring of 1965.(1) It would then be a much smaller structure than what had been thought about earlier as indicated in the approved project description: 
The proposed structure will be one story of steel and load-bear ing masonry construction with brick exterior, The building will be air-conditioned throughout. It will house a short course lecture classroom seating 90 at tables or 225 with lecture seat ing, a laboratory demonstration area in which sprinkler systems, pumps, extinguishers, fire detection equipment, etc., can be demonstrated, and offices for the Firemanship Training Staff of the Engineering Extension Service.(2) 
Construction contracts were awarded in July 1966 and the building was ready for use by the middle of 1967.
