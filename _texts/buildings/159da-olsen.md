Facilities Building Built: 1973-75. 
Architects:  Durrant Deininger Dommer Kramer Gordon and  
Finch-Heery  
Contractor:  Huber Hunt &  Nichols  

This building was constructed under the same contract as the stadium and was an integral part of that project although it is a separate structure. 
In November 1976 the building was formally named the Ralph A. Olsen Building, recognizing Olsen's long support of the university and its athletic programs. A graduate of the class of 1923 Olsen and his wife donated $250,000 to the stadium project. 
The Olsen building serves as the administrative headquarters for the athletic department, offices for the football coaching staff and pro vides team locker and training rooms.
