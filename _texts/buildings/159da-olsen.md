This building was constructed under the same contract as the stadium and was an integral part of that project although it is a separate structure. 

In November 1976 the building was formally named the Ralph A. Olsen Building, recognizing Olsen's long support of the university and its athletic programs. A graduate of the class of 1923 Olsen and his wife donated $250,000 to the stadium project. 

The Olsen building serves as the administrative headquarters for the athletic department, offices for the football coaching staff and provides team locker and training rooms.
