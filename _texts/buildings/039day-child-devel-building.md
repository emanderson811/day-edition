The Biennial Report for 1928-30 included a request of $35,000 for a Nursery School for Home Economics and explained the need: 

>For several years past we have been using a remodeled horse barn for the nursery school. This year we are adding a remodeled residence located near it. The Nursery School and the work with small children by the students in Home Economics is rapidly growing in significance and value, and there is every reason to increase the capacity of the nursery school as soon as possible in order to give the girls in Home Economics more adequate opportunity to study small children. A new and suitably planned building with greater capacity than our present makeshift building is needed. 

No improvement or change in the Nursery School facilities was made until 1948 when the Temporary Building L became the school building (with staff offices in Morrill Hall).[^fn1]

The building now known as Child Development was built, together with the Nickell-Fisher House, as Duplexes A and B for Home Management. Both were built at the same time under the same contract. In 1957 Duplex A became the Paulena Nickell House and continued as a Home Management House until it was remodeled in 1962 when it became the Child Development Building.[^fn2]
