In mid 1967 the decision was reached to establish a special area to keep university owned vehicles used for off-campus travel. Part of the total project was a building to provide office space for the dispatcher and records and a service and repair space for vehicles. The Physical Plant prepared the area with a surrounding fence, surfacing of the parking space and approach drives. 

After changing the concept from that of a masonry building, which proved to be too expensive, Mr. Curry was retained to prepare plans for a prefabricated steel building.  

The contract for construction was awarded in August of 1969. The work was completed the following April.
