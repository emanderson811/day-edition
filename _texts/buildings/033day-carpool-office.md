Built: 1969-70 Architect: Norval H. Curry Contractor: Siedlemann Construction Co. 
In mid 1967 the decision was reached to establish a special area to keep university owned vehicles used for off-campus travel. Part of the total project was a building to provide office space for the dis patcher and records and a service and repair space for vehicles. The Physical Plant prepared the area with a surrounding fence, sur facing of the parking space and approach drives. 
After changing the concept from that of  a  masonry building, which  
proved  to be  too expensive, Mr.  Curry was  retained  to prepare plans  
for  a  prefabricated steel building.  
The  contract  for construction was  awarded  in August of 1969.  The  
work was  completed the following April.
