Authorization to acquire a synchrotron was given by the Board in January 1947, and at the same time planning for a building to house the equipment was initiated.[^fn1] Architects were selected the following month, at the same time the site for the installation was approved. 

Bids for construction were received in October 1947, but all were rejected and the project was rebid and contracts were awarded in May 1948.[^fn2] It was also necessary to develop a water supply system and electric power, and to provide an access road to the site in the area previously referred to as Recreation Area. 

The construction was completed and accepted in September 1949.[^fn3]

Cost of the synchrotron and the building was paid for from fees received from the federal government on the atomic project.[^fn4] 

The synchrotron was deactivated on January 1, 1971, and subsequently removed.[^fn5] Since then the building has been used for other academic and office functions.
