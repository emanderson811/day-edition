Built: 1948-49 Architect: Tinsley, Higgins & Lighter Contractor: Kucharo Construction Co. 
Authorization to acquire a synchrotron was given by the Board in 
January 1947, and at the same time planning for a building to house 
the equipment was initiated.(3) Architects were selected the follow 
ing month, at the same time the site for the installation was approved. 
Bids for construction were received in October 1947, but all were re 
jected and the project was rebid and contracts were awarded in May 1948.(4) It was also necessary to develop a water supply system and electric power, and to provide an access road to the site in the area previously referred to as Recreation Area. 
The construction was completed and accepted in September 1949.(5)
