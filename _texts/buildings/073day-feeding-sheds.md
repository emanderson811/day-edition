Cattle Shed; Hog Barn 
Built: 1902 (?) Addition: 1903, 1916 
These sheds were apparently started soon after the fire which destroyed the earlier Feeding Barn and the original Experiment Station Barn in October 1901. They were built at about the same location as the burned structure. The March 25, 1903, issue 0f the ISC Student re ported that "The experiment station feed sheds will be enlarged by a forty-foot addition" and three days later stated "The contract for the feeding shed went to C.E. Atkinson, of Webster City, for $1565."(1) The building list for 1903 shows a valuation of $2500 for the Feeding Sheds. 
In 1916 the Iowa State Student records that "Superintendent of Grounds, Thos. Sloss, is also adding a new experiment feeding shed ... in the feed lots near the power house. This is reflected in the valuation increase to $3659 in the 1918 Financial Report. 
The Feeding Sheds as shown on the 1921 map formed an L-shaped struc 
ture with a north-south leg at the west end about 150 feet long and 
an east-west leg on the north ~80 feet long. The feed lots were on 
the inside of the L.

In 1928 the Feeding Sheds were moved to the Animal Husbandry farm on Beach Avenue south of Lincoln Way, today's Iowa State Center area, and razed in 1957.
