>Moved to Bee Farm: 1924

A honey and bee house was authorized for the Entomology Section of the Agricultural Experiment Station at the October 11, 1916, meeting of the Board. A small building called "Apiary" appears on the 1921 campus map, located just north of Osborn Drive about on a line with what is today the west side of Davidson Hall. It appears to have been about 10 x 15 feet in size (if drawn to reasonably accurate scale on that map). 

In the spring of 1924 authorization was given to move "the smaller bee house used by the experiment station to the new bee farm (the Kimble ten acres), as soon as convenient."(1) 

The Apiary was shown on the building list from 1918 to 1924 with a valuation of $167. There is no subsequent record of its value or even its existence on the Apiary farm (Kimble acreage on Arbor Street - now referred to as Farm Ma~ntenance area).
