Built: 1961-64 Architect: Burns & Roe, Inc.(a division of the American Machine and Foundry Company) Contractor: Mason Construction, Inc. 
The earliest reference to this project appeared in the August 14, 1958, edition of the Iowa.State Daily where it was recorded that the building had been approved by Congress and by the President but that the appro priation bill was still subject to congressional action. This was an Atomic Energy Commission operation for the Ames Laboratory with only federal funding to cover costs. 
By the end of 1959 the appropriation had been made and in January 1960 design of the facility was started.(1) The construction contract was awarded in April 1961, at which time the building was described: 
The facility ....will have a total gross area of 38,900 square 
feet. The reactor will be a 5,000 kilowatt, heavy-watt moderated 
research reactor with all embedded systems sized for future con 
version to 10,000 kilowatts . 
. . . .The reserach reactor facility will be used to help determine what happens to materials in a radiation field, to produce radio active nuclides for inorganic and analytical chemistry studies, to search for a better understanding of the relationships between structure and properties of materials, to study the behavior of materials in the environment of an operating reactor and to in vestigate corrosion of metal containers by liquid metals in the prescence of high neutron flu~.(2) 
In April of 1962 it was reported that the project was about 20% com pleted. A cornerstone unveiling ceremony was held during Veishea in May 1963. On September 11, 1965, the paper reported that this was one 
of the buildings that had been completed. 
Actual operation of the reactor was started on February 17, 1965.(3) 
The reactor was deactivated and completely removed from' the building 
in 1978. The building has sin~~ been used for other Ames Laboratory 
activities.
