In July 1958 the proposal was made to purchase the 80-acre farm then owned by Helen Kooser Campbell and "that the property continue to be used by the Animal Husbandry Department until that department moves to an outlying farm, and that the property then be used for married students and/or dormitory development."(1) The farm was located on the east side of Stange Road extending from a line a little way north of Squaw Creek to 24th Street. In October of that same year, after the purchase of the land had been formalized, Dr. J.C. Schilletter, director of residence, was quoted as saying "About 500 units for married housing will eventually be buil~' on the farm.(2) 
But five years passed before action started with the retention of the architect in April 1963 .. A year later the preliminary plans were approved for a total of 300 units.(3) Contracts for construction of 
the housing units were awarded at the August 5-7, 1964, Board meeting. A project budget of $3,285,000 was approved at that time. Separate contractswereentered into for building the streets and parking lots and for the sewer and water main systems. 
The first 70 units were ready for occupancy in November 1965 and the 
remaining ones were completed by September 1966. 
Approval to proceed with Phase II of the project was granted by the 
Board at its meeting of October 6~7, 1966. Phase II included 200 new 
housing units, a laundry building and an administration-maintenance 
building. Construction began in April 1967 and was completed by Sep 
tember 1968.
