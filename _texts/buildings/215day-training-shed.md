The Athletic Council, in December 1904, submitted a request to the Board of Trustees: 

>1.   Permission to build a training shed about 35 x lOO feet, located just south of the water tower. The long way of the shed to run east and west. 
>
>2.   Permission to use such doors and windows, which have accumulated from the wreckage of buildings and are now in charge of the Custodian, as may be found serviceable. 
>
>3.   Permission to use the stone near the Veterinary Barn and other wreckage foundation material in charge of the Custodian, for the foundation of the training shed. 
>
>4.   Permission to purchase such supplies as may be desirable for use in the construction of the building through the Purchasing Committee of the College. 
>
>It is highly desirable that whatever you may see fit to do with these petitions should be done at once, in order that the shed may be ready for service before the opening of the Spring Semester. 

The trustees referred the request to the Building and Public Grounds Committees with power to act.[^fn1]

That affirmative action was taken quickly is evidenced by the report in the January 25, 1905, issue of the *ISC Student*: "The training shed is practically completed. As soon as the cinders have been put in, training will innnediately commence." On February 1 the paper referred to it as "not a thing of particular beauty." 

In April it was reported to the Board of Trustees that "The lumber of the old Public Grounds barn and the stone in the foundation of the same were turned over to the Athletic Assoc. to be used in the erection of an athletic training shed." The Public Grounds barn referred to is undoubtedly the building elsewhere recorded as the President's Barn. 

Improvements were made in 1907. 

>When the state ordered East Cottage torn down they were asked for seventy dollars with which to remodel the training shed so it could be used for dressing rooms. From the decided way in which they refused, one would have thought they had been asked for seventy thousand. The athletic council has decided to fix the shed at its own expense and a dressing room will be built, lathed and plastered, where the men can change clothes without making a noise like an icicle. [^fn2] 

There is no record of when the building was razed. It is shown on a 1912 campus map. It had to have been removed before the addition to Engineering Annex was started in 1914. It was probably taken down in that year or perhaps in 1913.
