When the Experiment Barn burned in October 1901 it became immediately necessary to provide new facilities. Plans were prepared, bids taken and a contract for construction executed in May 1902.(1) By October it was possible to record that "Work on the new experiment .station barn is about completed, and the station expects to move into its new quarters the early part of next week."(2) 
Total cost of the project was $17,858.59 as itemized in the Biennial Report for 1902-03. 
This was a substantial brick building, 100' long east to west, by SO' wide, with two flodrs and a loft. It faced south and had an 18 
foot diameter conical roofed silo on the northwest corner. 
The building was struck by lightning and completely destroyed by fire on October 6, 1922. Combined loss of building and contents was listed as $25,771,66.(3)
