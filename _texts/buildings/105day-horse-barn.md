The east leg of the U-shaped Horse Barn was the first unit built, in 1923, and was then called Horse Barn #2. It was designed to provide twelve stalls and a paddock room.(l) 
The second unit comprised the base of the U, on the north side, planned as the machine shed, and the east leg for horse stables. It was constructed in the summer and fall of 1926. 
The two units were carried separately on the records until 1969 when they were combined under the designation "Horse Barn".
