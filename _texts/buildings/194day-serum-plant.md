**Razed:** 1926 [^fn1]

This building was located at what is now the northwest corner of the Veterinary Clinic. It was a U-shaped structure 100 feet wide with the two wings, each 40 feet wide by 150 feet long, built of brick and with cement floor. It faced south. 

A hog-cholera epidemic in 1913 resulted in the loss of 25 percent of the state's swine population.[^fn2] The Serum Plant was erected that year, on an emergency basis, to produce a serum to counteract the disease. A special state appropriation provided for construction, equipment and some operating costs, although the total operation was assumed to be self-supporting. 

The plant continued in operation until 1920 when the governor ordered it shut down when operational costs became too high for the reduced demand for the serum.[^fn3] 

From then until the building was razed it was used for research by the veterinary medicine division.
