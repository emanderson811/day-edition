The Cow Wing of the Clinic was the first unit of this building. It is the east wing of the structure. The construction contract was awarded on June 30, 1926, and the work was completed and accepted on December 1 of that year. It was planned as part of a larger structure to be completed at a later date. This unit was designed "for the purpose of carrying on special instruction concerning the diseases of cattle. This will be strictly educational work and will be used by a large group of our undergraduate students and by a group of veterinarians who already have gone out with not enough instruction in regard to the handling of cattle." [^fn1] 

At the Board meeting of June 5, 1934, President Hughes reported: "At the present time the clinical facilities for giving the upper class students actual practice in treating diseased animals is wholly in adequate and very unsatisfactory in arrangement. An expenditure of $133,000.00 for the completion of the Veterinary Clinic unit is very urgently needed." 

A state appropriation of $99,000 was made in early 1935, and a grant of $81,000 was received from the federal Public Works Administration in September 1936, assuring adequate funds for the construction of the second phase of the building. At the same time the name "Charles Henry Stange Memorial Veterinary Clinic" was approved by the Board.[^fn2] 

Construction of the new unit started in November 1936[^fn3] and it was completed a year later.[^fn4]

Dedication of the building took place on May 17, 1939. 

A very complete description of the building appeared in the *Iowa State Daily Student* on May 29, 1943. Only one sentence of that article is given here: "The clinic is divided into two sections, for the care of large and small animals and each is complete with separate examination and operating rooms."

In 1959 provisions were made to take care of the ambulatory service.[^fn5] 

Remodeling to provide an amphitheater for the operating room was a major change accomplished in 1964. 

The building was left vacant temporarily when the Veterinary Medicine College moved to the new facilities in 1976. 

In 1978 Industrial Education moved some of its operations into the building in anticipation of a remodeling project to provide all functions of that department with space in the old Clinic.
