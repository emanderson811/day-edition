These three buildings were planned and built as a single project. Construction contracts were entered into in June 1925, and the work was approved and accepted early in 1926. 

The two larger buildings, on the north and west, were built as stables for military horses and the smaller structure in the east as a barracks for the personnel in charge of the animals. 

An extensive remodeling of the buildings was undertaken in 1955 when they were made available for the use of the Division of Veterinary Medicine. They continued in that function until 1975 when all of those functions were moved to their new facilities on South Campus.
