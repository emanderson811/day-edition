Men's Physical Education Building 
Built: 1963~64 Architect: Savage & VerPloeg Contractor: Woodruff-Evans Construction Co. 
In 1956 the head of the Physical Education Department and the director of athletics were requesting new facilities because State Gymnasium was no longer adequate for their programs.(2) But it was the spring of 1961 before an appropriation was allocated by the 59th General Assembly to fund an addition to the old building.(3) 
The first mention of a separate building instead of an addition appeared in the Iowa State Daily on September 8, 1961, when the present location was reported as a change of plan. 
Bids were received on July 10, 1962, and contracts were awarded at the Board meeting of July 12-13.(4) Construction began the first week of August 1962 and the building was ready for use at the beginning of the 
fall quarter in 1964.
