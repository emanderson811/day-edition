The Towers (with Wallace &Wilson Halls) 
Built: 1964-66 Architects: Crites and McConnell Contractor: James Thompson & Sons 
Increasing enrollments led to the need for additional housing. The decision was reached to construct a hall for 1200 men with associated dining facilities. This was planned as the first unit in a complex ultimately to house 3600 men. However, only the first and second units were constructed as part of what is now called the Towers Resi dence area. 
Various sites were considered for the location of this large complex. One was the location on the portion of the golf course then south of the railroad on the north side of Pannnel Drive; another was the old horticulture farm. It was decided to use the poultry farm area and to relocate facilities thereon to a new off-campus site to the south.(2)

The architect agreement was approved in March 1963; plans were com pleted and bids were received in March 1964 with construction con tracts awarded the following month.(l) This project was planned with two buildings, each to house 600 men, and a connecting commons build ing for food service, lounges and other needs for general use. 
At that time it was sched,uled for the first hall to be completed for occupancy in the fall of 1965 and the second one the following year. Bad weather during  the construction period and strikes of workmen de layed completion of the project.(2) 
At the opening of the fall term in 1965 only enough work had been com pleted to allow 300 men to move in while the other 300 assigned to the hall had to be placed in triple rooms in Helser Hall. With the commons still unfinished, food service for those in the new building was pro vided at Linden Hall and Oak-Elm Hall. By November all rooms could be occupied and the commons was ready to provide food service after the Christmas vacation.(3) 
The second tower was ready for use in the fall of 1966. 
Storms Hall was named for Albert Boynton Storms, President of the college from 1903 to 1910. 
Knapp Hall was named for Seaman Asahel Knapp, college president 1883 84. 
In 1970 Knapp became coeducational with women's houses established in the hall. (4)
