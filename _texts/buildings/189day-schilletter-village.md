Built: 1973-76 
More married student housing units to the north of University Village were originally contemplated as Phase III of that project. In 1969 a revised project description was presented to the Board: 
....it was deemed desirable to introduce a different type of 
unit in order to avoid a monotonous appearance by too frequent 
repetition of the same type of structure. A new building type 
was, therefore, designed consisting of 12 units with 4 units on 
each of 3 floors; ... (l) 
That plan was abandoned, and after erection of a trial prefabricated four-plex unit at the Swine Nutrition Farm had proved satisfactory it was decided to use that type of structure for the next married stu dent housing project. 
Approval of a contract with Jon Crose and Associates for site planning design was given in May 1972.(2) In February 1973 contracts were a~ warded for the site work and for the erection of 11 prefabricated buildings. The prefabricated units were made by Sandler-Bilt Homes; site work and general construction was by R&F Builders, Inc. The buildings were occupied that fall. 
Another 25 units were added in 1974, again using Sandler-Bilt struc 
tures but with Allen Construction Co. as general contractor. 
Two more additions, in 1975 and 1976, added another 39 units to the 
village. 
The name of the village, authorized in May 1974, honors Dr. J.C. Schilletter who directed the residence systems over twenty years.
