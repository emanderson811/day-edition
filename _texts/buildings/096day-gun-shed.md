Built: 1916 Moved to Dairy Farm: 1924 
A building for the storage of rifles was authorized by the Board at their meeting of Aug. 9, 1916. By the end of October of that year 
it was noted that the final cost was $1536.06. 
It was built at a location along what is now the east side of Exhibit Hall. A forty foot long extension was added in 1918, and in the same year the building was moved to a location across the road to the north of Engineering Annex where its east end lined with the front of that building. The gun shed was then about 130 feet long and 24 feet wide. 
In the fall of 1922 after the new Armory had storage space for the rifles, the gun shed became an electric wiring laboratory, where prac tical electrical work was taught. 
By 1924 this was no longer a needed use and the building was moved to the Dairy Farm where it was fitted out as a dormitory.
