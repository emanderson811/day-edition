Tractor Garage 
Built: 1914 Razed: 1925 (?) 
Location: directly north of the north wing of Old Botany. 
The first request for a building to house large equipment for the Agri cultural Engineering Department appears in the Biennial Report for 1908 10 when the cost of a building 50 x 120 feet of steel frame, brick walls and slate roof was estimated at $6000. In the report two years later the cost estimate was $10,000. 
It was September 1914, however, before any funds were allocated and 
then only $100 was provided--for "a shed which shall contain two stalls for freight trucks, one stall for Superintendent's automobile, and three stalls for the dept. of Ag. Engr.11 (2) It was a frame building, 23 x 73 feet open to the east.

In 1916 an additional sum of $300 was provided to build a chimney and forge, to provide steam radiation in the forge compartment, and to make "a few slight improvements in the remaining five compartments." (1) 
The building is shown on a 1923 map but does not appear on one made in 1926. No specific reference has been found to determine the exact date it was razed.
