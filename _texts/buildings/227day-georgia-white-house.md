This house was built by Professor Lanphear (Lamphear) in 1901 "on the knoll west of Professor Stanton's." [^fn1] This was a site now identified as the court between the north and center east wings of Helser Hall. It was sold by his widow in 1906 to Professor Perry G. Holden who resided there until 1913 in which year he sold the house to the college for $5,600. 

The house was then called Margaret Hall Annex until 1919 when it became known as West Gate Cottage. It was damaged by fire on March 15, 1921. It housed women students from 1913 until 1922 when it was allocated to the Department of Hygiene to serve as a nurses' home. From January until June 1922 it was used for offices by the Military Department.[^fn2]

In 1925 the house was moved to a site immediately north of the Industrial Education wing of Davidson Hall. The name Georgia White Cottage was adopted in October 1928.[^fn3] It housed women from then until 1958 when Fred Tonne, Security Chief, rented it for his family home. He died in 1970 and his widow remained in the house until 1972. 

The house was razed in 1972.
