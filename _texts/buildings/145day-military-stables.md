Military Horse Barn 
Built: 1921 Razed: ca. 1932 
This building was located northeast of the cemetery, iust east of the edge o.f Pammel Woods. 
The Board minutes for June 8-10, 1921, provide about the only informa tion available on this structure: 
This building to accommodate approximately 100 horses and to be constructed with lumber donated by the War Department in build ings at Camp Dodge, will be located on the site of the former serum hog yards in the east border of College Park and directly west of the Horticulture Department nursery. The plans and the exact location are to be determined by the President of the Col lege with the approval of the Building and Business Committee. 
The following month the Minutes record that $8000 was allocated for "Military Horse Barn, including special provision for blacksmith, harness, and guard in separate small building on account of fire risk," and an additional fund of $400 to provide water for the building. The site was changed from that mentioned the previous month. 
When new masonry stables were constructed north of the Veterinary Clinic building the old frame stables were used for storage of machinery of the Agricultural Engineering department.(l) 
The exact date when the frame stables were razed is not known. The building value is recorded at $300 in the June 30, 1932, annual report. The June 30, 1933, report shows that value removed from the records, indicating the elimination of the building between those two dates.
