This shop was located in the Physical Plant area, a site now covered by the south wing of the Physical Plant Shops and Central Stores Building. 

A building to be constructed as a college laundry was first discussed by the Board in June, 1923, but it was the following March before action was taken. It was then recorded: 

>In developing plans (for a Laundry Building) it has seemed best to enlarge the building and after inspecting the plant at Vinton it was decided to make the laundry room 40 x 50 feet. For good reason, also, space for the chemical truck has been provided in the plans for this building. 

A maximum allocation of $18,500 was then authorized. The construction contract was awarded at the May 22, 1924, Meeting of the Board. 

The *Iowa State Student* of September 22, 1924, reported that the building has "just been completed" and described it: 

>The plant has been made large enough to take care of all the college laundry, including the linen from the halls, the gymnasium towels, hospital materials, and, in fact, everything that belongs to the college which has a possibility of getting dirty. 
>
>With the completion of the building, in which has been built a room for the college fire department, the three college fire fighters are planning to move the truck in soon....

The building was still serving the same functions in 1930.[^fn1] In 1958 the building is recorded as the "Electric Shop".
