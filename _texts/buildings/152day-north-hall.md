Servants' Hall, Margaret Hall Annex 
Built: 1880 Architect: Prof. T.L. Smith Contractor: F.S. Whiting Razed: 1926 
Located iu~t south of present west wing of MacKay Hall. 
An appropriation was made in the spring of 1880 for "a building to be occupied by the schools of Agriculture and Veterinary Science and the Botanical Department." Contract for construction was awarded in May in the amount of $5752 to F.S. Whiting. Professor S.A. Knapp was appointed superintendent, who reported in December as follows: "The plans for this building were somewhat carefully matured to secure a very substantial structure and one that would in all respects meet the necessities of the several departments to be accommodated. The Professors interested express themselves as more than gratified at the results achieved."(l) 
The building was completed for occupancy early in 1881. On April 8, 1882 a tornado crossed the campus. "North Hall had both gable ends blown in above the first floor, and all the roof carried away except a small portion in the center."(2) Repairs were made the next month. A porch was added on the front (south side) in 1886. Two years later a water supply and coal stoves were provided. 
When Margaret Hall was built in 1894 North Hall became an attached wing of the new building. The lower floor was made into a kitchen, the second floor was remodeled for the Department of Domestic Economy and living rooms, while the attic was set up for servants' rooms. 
North Hall was taken down in 1926.
