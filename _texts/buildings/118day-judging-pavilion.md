Built: 1924-25 Architect: Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson Contractor: Thomas Sloss 
Planning for a judging pavilion was discussed in 1921(3) but it was 
1924 before work on the building was started. Bids were received in 
September of that year.(4) All bids exceeded the $18,000 appropriated 
and were re.iected. The following month an additional $2,000 was made 
available and the construction of the building was made a pro;ect for 
Superintendent Sloss and his department. 
The pavilion was completed by October 1925 when funds were allocated 
for fencing of the adjacent areas.(5) 
In 1931 President Hughes reported that "the Judging Pavilion had been remodeled somewhat in order to make it serviceable for public speaking."(6)
