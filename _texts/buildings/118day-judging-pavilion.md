Planning for a judging pavilion was discussed in 1921[^fn1] but it was 1924 before work on the building was started. Bids were received in September of that year.[^fn2] All bids exceeded the $18,000 appropriated and were rejected. The following month an additional $2,000 was made available and the construction of the building was made a project for Superintendent Sloss and his department. 

The pavilion was completed by October 1925 when funds were allocated for fencing of the adjacent areas.[^fn3] 

In 1931 President Hughes reported that "the Judging Pavilion had been remodeled somewhat in order to make it serviceable for public speaking."[^fn4]
