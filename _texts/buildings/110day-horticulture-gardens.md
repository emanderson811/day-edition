This building was one element of the larger project involving the relocation of the Horticulture Gardens from the area of Bessey Hall to the present site east of Haber Road and north of Sixth Street.  

Bids were received in June 1968 and the project was completed in February 1970.

The work included the building to provide storage for maintenance materials and equipment, but also involved the construction of the gardens, walks, and total area development. 

The horticulture gardens are used as a part of the teaching process as well as providing a display for the public.
