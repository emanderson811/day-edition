A new dormitory for women was programmed in June 1945, and in September the *Iowa State Daily Student* reported that it was "ready to erect as soon as contracting costs decrease to a less inflated level and materials become more available." At that time the appropriation was $450,000.[^fn1] In 1946 the cost estimate was raised to $500,000 and an architect was retained to initiate plans.[^fn2] 

In December 1946 the name Linden Hall was assigned to the proposed building and preliminary plans were approved.[^fn3] But inflation and the more immediate need to provide housing for returning veterans further delayed construction, and it was 1954 before further action was taken. By that time revision of the plans had become necessary to provide a larger facility and the cost had risen to an estimated $1,900,000.[^fn4] The revised plans were approved in February 1955. Contracts for construction were awarded in October of that year and construction began in November.[^fn5] 

Linden Hall was completed and in use in September 1957.
