When planning for this building started in March 1969, it was studied with the concept of providing for four elements:[^fn1] 

>1. Television Station facilities 
>
>2. Radio Station facilities 
>
>3. Film Production Service facilities 
>
>4. Television teaching facilities 


After study of the schematic designs and in consideration of funds available it was decided to proceed with plans for only the first two facilities, with the others to be provided at a later time. [^fn2] 

Plans were completed and bids received in August 1962, and construction started shortly thereafter. The project was financed entirely by WOI-TV accumulated funds with no tax money included.[^fn3] 

During the last week of March 1964 the radio facilities moved from the Service Building (Snedecor Hall) to the new Communications Building, and the first WOI-AM radio broadcast from the new location came on March 27.[^fn4] It was another two months, however, until TV and some other facilities were able to move into the then completed building.[^fn5] 

In 1978 planning began for an addition to the north side of the building. The new structure provides a large storage area, a garage for operational vehicles and a new scene shop. Remodeling in the original building makes an expanded news area and offices for the news director and sports editor.
