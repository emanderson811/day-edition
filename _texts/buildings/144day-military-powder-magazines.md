(Two Structures) 
Built: 1924 and 1929 Razed: 1948 
These two magazines were built on the east edge of Pammel Woods, be tween the corral north of the old Military Stables and the Northwestern tracks. 
The first magazine is shown in the list of college buildings in the secretary's report for 1924, with a value of $322.23. 
Board minutes for October 9, 1928, show authorization for a "black powder magazine to separate this powder from the other kinds of ex plosives, of necessity stored in the magazine, to conform to the regu lations of the War Department for the protection of all property." This unit carried a value of $300 in the reports. 
Both magazines were eliminated from the building list in 1948. 
An entry in the Board minutes for April 17-18, 1919, indicates an earlier structure had been erected, but its location is unknown today: 
Powder House. One hundred dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated from the Repairs and Minor Improvements Fund to provide for the storage of powder to be fur nished by the War Department.
