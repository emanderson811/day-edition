Although President Pearson expressed the need for better hospital facilities in 1913, it was almost two years later before the Board Architect was directed to start planning for a new building.(1) Con struction started at the end of October 1916. Contracts for cut stone and for steel were awarded to Arthur Watson and Western Builders Supply Co., respectively at the Nov. 10, 1916, Board meeting. 
This first unit is the east-west section, facing north. A north-south wing on the east was also planned then. The new building was opened for use in May 1918. It was fully described at that time: 
Iowa State College's new $50,000 hospital, one of the best of its kind on the college campus' of America, will be opened this week. No plans have been made for the dedication of the new building but its formal opening may be held at some time in the future. Plans for commencement week and the closing of school has made such arrangements an impossibility at this time.

The equipment and furniture are of the very best and have been chosen both for simplicity and durability. 
The kitchens are up-to-date and practical. On the first floor is the large general kitchen and on second and third floors are the smaller dietary kitchens. The food is prepared in the general kitchen, then is sent on the dumb waiter to the others, where the trays are arranged and taken to the patients. Extension phones connect the three kitchens. 
An electric elevator has been installed at a great expense. The electric signal system in all the rooms does away with the un necessary noise of bells. The patient pushes a button which 
lights a red light over the door and thus calls the nurse. 
On the first floor are boys and girls waiting rooms, the big dis pensary rooms, and doctor's office. 
The big airy wards are a feature of the hospital. One end of 
the hospital is for the boys and the other for the girls. These 
are wards for two, three or four patients and the big windows make them most desirable places. Another feature is the parents' 
room. Here special accomodations have been provided so parents 
may stay near their children who are ill if they wish. 
There are also many single rooms for patients which are light 
and cheerful. 
On each floor there is a supply room and "report" room for the 
nurses. Thus they are enabled to keep their reports easily and 
systematically and of easy access. 
The sterilizing equipment is of the very best. Steam pressure 
sterilizers for all the instruments and utensils have been pro 
vided. The articles to be sterilized are placed in a vat and 
steam pressure turned on which sterilizes them in a few minutes. 
The operating room on the top floor has the newest equipment. 
The room is walled with green tile and has the white furniture. 
The sterilizing room and cupboard for the special linen open 
off from this room. Here also they have a gas burner in which 
to burn all refuse. 
Large linen closets, special rooms for eye, ear and nose cases, 
janitors quarters and dining room for the nurses add to the effi 
ciency of the hospital. 
The walls are all white, with white woodwork, tile floors and 
mahogany.doors. There are living rooms and waiting rooms on 
all floors, furnished in oak and wicker furniture, which is 
most inviting. The rooms are furnished in oak.and white hospi tal beds. 
The hospital has been pronounced as second to none of this kind. Dr. Tilden will be the doctor in charge and Miss Crouston and Mrs. Knipe will be nurses in charge.(l) 
By 1923 a larger facility was needed. In the February 26, 1923, copy of the Iowa Stare Student it was reported that 
The legislators would find the college hospital running over, and patients lining both sides of the halls and in emergency quarters elsewhere. Not only now, when the number of patients is higher than usual, but for the greater part of the year they would find the hospital overcrowded and inadequate. 
Plans for the addition were prepared during the year and the construc tion contract was awarded at the December 7, 1923, meetfng of the Board. The building became ready for use in January 1925. The con struction included the east wing and also an enlarged kitchen and a sun room on the west end of the original unit. 
Minor changes were made in 1934, 1940, 1950 and 1951. In 1960 the elevator was replaced as was the dumbwaiter.(2) 
A major renovation was undertaken in 1967. This involved considerable remodeling of the ground and first floors with a new ambulance access platform at the west end of the building and new kitchen access at the south end of the east wing. 
In 1974 the contract was awarded for extensive remodeling of the building to provide office spaces for the Dean of Students and for Student Counseling Service, with Student Health Services remaining in a portion of the building. 
The building was renamed Student Services Building in 1978.
