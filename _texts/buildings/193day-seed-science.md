Seed Laboratory 
Built: 1976-77 Architect: Wilkins, Bussard & Kikis Contractor: Allen Construction Co. 
The Seed Laboratory which had been housed in Botany Hall and had long been in need of larger and more efficient space received a state ap propriation for a new building in 1975. Work on the building program had started the preceding fall and it was ready when the architect was selected in March 1975. 
Schematic dr~wings were presented to and approved by the Board in Sep tember 1975. During the next eight months the drawings were developed and specifications were written. Contracts for construction were a warded in July 1976 and work on the building began later that month. The building was occupied in December 1977. 
The laboratory includes space for seed testing operations, administra tive offices, research space, teaching space and an area for the Iowa Crop Improvement Association facilities. A contributi.on of $275,000 had been made to the project by that organization.
