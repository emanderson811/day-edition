The Seed Laboratory which had been housed in Botany Hall and had long been in need of larger and more efficient space received a state appropriation for a new building in 1975. Work on the building program had started the preceding fall and it was ready when the architect was selected in March 1975. 

Schematic drawings were presented to and approved by the Board in September 1975. During the next eight months the drawings were developed and specifications were written. Contracts for construction were awarded in July 1976 and work on the building began later that month. The building was occupied in December 1977. 

The laboratory includes space for seed testing operations, administrative offices, research space, teaching space and an area for the Iowa Crop Improvement Association facilities. A contribution of $275,000 had been made to the project by that organization.
