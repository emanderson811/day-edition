The "Feed Barn" is shown on the 1883 map in a location about 600 feet east of the Farm Barn. This is at a location just at the southeast corner of the present Agronomy Greenhouse. 

This barn was built in 1880 under contract with F.S. Whiting in the amount of $725. Painting and other costs brought the total expenditure to $792.10. 

In 1890 Experimental Station Director Speer was authorized to use proceeds from sale of Station products for repair of the barn. 

A fire starting in this barn in October 1901 destroyed it and the Experiment Station Barn.
