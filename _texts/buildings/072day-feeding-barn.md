Built: 1880 Architect: Prof. T.L. Smith Contractor: F,S. Whiting Burned: 1901 
The "Feed Barn" is shown on the 1883 map in a location about 600 feet east of the F&rm Barn. This is at a location just at the southeast corner of the present Agronomy Greenhouse. 
This barn was built in 1880 under contract with F.S. Whiting in the amount of $725. Painting and other costs brought the total expendi 
ture to $792 .10. 
In 1890 Experimental Station Director Speer was authorized to use pro ceeds from sale of Station products for repair of the barn. 
A fire starting in this barn in October 1901 destroyed it and the Ex periment Station Barn.
