The north wing of Birch Hall (Dormitory #5) was funded in June and work started in September of 1922, although the complete building was planned originally. No dining facilities were included in the first unit.(1) The foundation was prepared by the Building and Grounds department, who also performed all plumbing and heating work for the building. The superstructure (three stories) was built under contract as was the electrical installation. 
The hall was ready for occupancy in the fall term of 1923 and the name Birch Hall was s~lected.(2) 
The addition to Birch Hall, comprising the south wing and the "L" to the west, and known as Dormitory #6, was bid in January 1924, although excavation for the foundation had been started the preceding month. It was completed early in 1925. 
In 1928 Birch Hall was officially renamed Welch Hall East, but in 1937 it reverted to Birch Hall. 
Extensive renovation of Birch-Welch-Roberts Halls was undertaken in 1969-70. After the remodeling Birch and the other two halls became homes for men instead of women.
