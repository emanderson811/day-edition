Built: 1969-70 Architect: Woodburn & O'Neil Contractor: James Thompson & Sons 
An appropriation of $900,000 for this building was made in 1965 and the architect was chosen in September of that year. Additional funds were obtained later from irants under the Higher Education Facilities Act and a second state appropriation in 1967. 
The original concept for the design of the building was for a complete ly separate structure to be located between East Hall and the Dairy Industries Building or in that area. One of the early schemes showed it on a north-south axis to the east of East Hall. 
The final plans incorporated the connecting link to make access 
easier between the new structure and East Hall. Both buildings are 
used by the Departments of Economics and Sociology and Anthropology. 
Contracts for construction were awarded in January 1969 and work was completed in November 1970.
