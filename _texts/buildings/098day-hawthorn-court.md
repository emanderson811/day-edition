The need for married student housing was becoming more acute by 1954 and Pammel Court facilities were too limited to take care of the requests. During 1955 plans for duplex type units were developed and financing for the project was worked out. 

Construction contracts were awarded for the first 96 units in April 1956.[^fn1] In June the name "Hawthorn" was adopted. By September the paper was able to report that "the first 28 families have moved into Hawthorn Apartments ...the second 82-apartment area should be occupied about a month later and the third section available around Dec. 1." [^fn2] 

These apartments proved very successful and satisfactory to the tenants. 

Approval to build an additional 100 units came early in 1958. Construction began in September and was completed the following September. Only minor changes were made in the plans for the second group of apartments.[^fn3]
