Located just in front of and east of the center of the Metals Development Building. 

Dean Curtiss first requested a house for the field superintendent in September of 1914, when he was directed to have plans prepared and a site recommended.[^fn1] However, it was August 1916 before funds were provided. 

By the next January it could be reported: 

>We have completed a house for our horticultural foreman at a cost of $2100. This will enable the man having direct charge of the horticultural barn and orchards to live adjacent to where he works, instead of a mile and a half distant. It will give us more of his time, and this will be especially valuable during the fruit-growing and ripening seasons.[^fn2] 

The first tenant was L.V. Gowdey with rent free starting Jan. 1, 1917.

In May 1959 the house was sold to C.A. Haugsted, who moved it to Ontario. He paid $826.50 to the college and the Atomic Energy Commission paid the difference between that figure and the appraised value of $7500.[^fn3]
