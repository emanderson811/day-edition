Dean Curtiss first requested a house for the field superintendent in September of 1914, when he was directed to have plans prepared and a site recommended.(l) However, it was August 1916 before funds were provided. 
By the next January it could be reported: 
We have completed a house for our horticultural foreman at a cost of $2100. This will enable the man having direct charge of the horticultural barn and orchards to live adjacent to where he works, instead of a mile and a half distant. It will give us more of his time, and this will be especially valuable during the fruit-growing'and ripening seasons.(2) 
The first tenant was L.V. Gowdey with rent free starting Jan. 1, 1917.

1926 -1935 H.J. Bechtel, Field Foreman
