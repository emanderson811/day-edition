Located about fifty-feet west of Horticulture Hall (site of 1978 addition) 

This two-story frame house was built for J.J. Edgerton with an appropriation of $1,000. [^fn1] A bath tub was installed in 1904 while Pro fessor Holden lived there. Steam was extended to the house in 1913. 

In 1915 the building was moved to the area south of the Physical Plant where it was the easternmost of the five frame houses located there until the addition to the Women's Gymnasium was built. It was razed in 1970.
