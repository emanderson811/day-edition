Planning for this hall started in the spring of 1927 and construction contracts were awarded in May 1928. The buiding was accepted on March 1, 1929. 

This unit completed the south side and southwest corner of the dormitory group which included Lyon, Freeman, Barton and Birch Halls. It was completed at a cost of $194,450. 

The building was described in the April 23, 1929, issue of the *Iowa State Student*: 

>The Mary B. Welch West Hall, which held its open house last Saturday, is named after the wife of the first president of Iowa State. She was also the founder of the Home Economics Division. 
>
>The new hall is a dignified brick colonial of four stories with a solid, massive front door which is characteristic of the northern colonial style. One of the parlors is attractively furnished with comfortable chairs of various styles; a davenport and chair in futuristic design; a magazine chest; and tables including end tables and davenport table. In the Fireplace Lounge, there is a huge fireplace of interesting design. This room has been furnished to carry out the early American idea. Chintz curtains, hooked rugs, colonial wrought iron fixtures, ladder-back chairs, butter fly table, and the old-fashioned geranium plant have been used to make a typical setting for the fire place of natural wood with nails showing. In another parlor, wicker furniture with gay cushions make the room comfortable.
>
>Special features of the new hall are buzzers which are connected with each room from the office. The office is set off by a high counter. There is a service closet for packages and a long distance telephone booth. Another feature is the kitchenette near one of the parlors which may be used for candy making by the girls and their friends as well as teas and parties. At the heads of three stairs are large mirrors.
>
>The dining room holds 18 tables with 8 girls at a table. Hard wood floors have been laid so that the room can be used for dancing when parties are given. There is a storage room for the tables during this time. The kitchen is fully equipped with the latest type of institutional equipment. The kitchen is used in connnon with Mary B. Welch East which is an entirely separate unit. 
>
>The chaperone has a suite consisting of a parlor, bedroom, large closet and bath. The furniture is walnut of colonial style. On the first floor is a suite for four girls. The middle room has two double decked cots and on each side is a study and dressing room for two. A tower room on the fourth floor accommodates six girls. 
>
>The rooms are similar to those in the other dormitories. There is running hot water as well as cold in each of the rooms. Every room has cots, study table, chest of drawers, and three chairs, The chairs are straight, posture chairs specially designed for girls.
>
>Similar to the other halls, the girls are given positions of responsibility by serving as hostess at the heads of the tables in the dining room and by attending to the routine duties in the corridor. Special care is given to the emphasis of the college rulings.

In 1969 a complete remodeling of the interior of this hall, together with Birch and Roberts Halls, was started. With completion of that work in 1971, these became men's residence halls.
