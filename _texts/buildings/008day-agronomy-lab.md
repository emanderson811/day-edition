The building was designed as an "Antigenic Laboratory" for the study of irradiation effects on swine. The A.E.C. awarded the construction contract in June 1960, and _the facility was put into use the following year. 
By 1969 the A.E.C. research project had been completed, the building was conveyed to the University, and the lease was terminated.(l) 
The space was then allocated for use by the department of Agronomy and the building name changed accordingly.
