The contract for the original Engineering Hall was awarded in July 1882 to V. Tomlinson in the amount of $4890, just slightly below the $5000 appropriation. Even before the building was completed in the fall of 1883 it was recognized that it was too small for the growing engineering demands, and a request to the legislature was made for funds for an addition. 

The addition, completed in 1885, is the present wing on the south extending to the west. 

Remodeling of the basement in 1898-99 provided facilities for a hydraulics laboratory. 

Major remodeling was undertaken in 1907 and completed at a total cost of $10,550. Dean Marston described the project at the time: 

> I would further say that the College is securing by this work out of this old building, which was formerly practically of little account, what amounts to a good, substantial, modern laboratory building of fireproof construction except as to the roof, which I believe, could not be built new for less than $25,000. I would further say that the building in its present condition will be of no value whatever and that, in fact, it will be so exposed to the elements as it is, as to be greatly damaged to go through the winter without being completed.[^fn1]

Toilet facilities were installed in 1923. 

A one story addition was built in 1933, making a rectangular plan by filling in the earlier L-shape. This became the concrete laboratory.

Further remodeling came in 1967, described as follows:

This project will provide additional office space, classroom and improved laboratory facilities to make the existing building more functional and efficient. The very antiquated rest room will be made more usable. Fire escapes from the second and third floors will reduce the dangers now imminent in the event of fire in a building with only one stairway. Because this is one of the oldest buildings on campus it is not justifiable to attempt any major improvements, and the contemplated renovation has been kept to a bare minimum to extend the useful life of the building as long as possible.[^fn2]

Total project cost of the 1967 remodeling came to $30,577.
