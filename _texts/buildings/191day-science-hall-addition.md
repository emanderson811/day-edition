Built: 1969-73 Architect: James Lynch & Associates Contractor: James Thompson & Sons 
The Board of Regents request for capital improvement funds for the 1965-67 biennium included $1.1 million for a science building addi tion. (1) The money was not allocated that year, bu,t two years later an appropriation was made in the amount of $2,400,0QO,. An additional $996,000 came from Higher Education Facilities grants. 
The addition was planned as a completely sepera,te building. The build ing program showed most of the net useable area (48,500 sq. ft.) allocated for zoology and entomology, with 11,150 sq. ft. for psychology and 7800 sq. ft. for general classroom area, and an alternate to provide 1300 sq. ft. for earth science observation space on the roof. The building program was given to the architect on the first of November 1967 and his preliminary plans were approved by the Board at the April 1968 meeting. 
Bids for construction were received on October 2, 1969, and construc 
tion started the following month. The building was substantially com 
pleted by the end of 1972 but it was the following March before occu 
pancy came about. 
Before the building had been completed some changes ins.pace assign ments had been made. Facilities were provided to house the Fish, and' Wildlife Biology and space for psychology was eliminated, resulting 
from a reduction in total area necessitated by cost inflation.(2)
