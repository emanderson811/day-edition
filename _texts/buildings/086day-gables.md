President Welch purchased land and built a home just south of the College property in 1879. This is the present location of Buchanan Hall.

The house was built by a Mr. Turner.[^fn1] The Welch family moved into the house in late 1880. The cyclone of April 8, 1882 "removed a few of the Chimneys".[^fn2] The house was described at the time the Welch heirs were planning to sell it: 

>It consists of a two-story brick house and four acres of ground. In contains nine rooms and a commodious hallway, with a cellar under the entire house. It is well constructed and tastefully furnished throughout. The grounds are finely landscaped and beautifully ornamented by shrubs and trees, which have now grown to pleasing proportions. The property can be bought for $3,000. [^fn3] 

Professor Millikan Stalker purchased "The Gables", as it was called, in 1898 or 1899 and moved into it in 1899. He willed it to his sister, Sallie Stalker Smith, who, in turn willed it to her sisters, Margaret Stalker and Julia Stalker Swearingen during their lifetimes. After their deaths the property was to go to Iowa State College in the names of Milliken Stalker and Sallie Stalker Smith to further the cause of international good will. 

Ownership of the property passed to the College in 1928. The Gables became International House as a residence for foreign male students 
in compliance with Mrs. Smith's will. 

A fire on January 7, 1951 resulted in extensive damage to the house. Repair costs were covered by the dormitory insurance policy. General construction costs came to $9,366 and the work was done by James Thompson & Sons. Painting, electrical and plumbing work was done by the Physical Plant department at a cost of $1,634.

The house continued in use by foreign students until it was purposely burned down in 1963 to make way for Buchanan Hall which continued as a foreign student residence. 

Occupants of the house are listed by Dorothy Kehlenbeck[^fn4] as follows:
