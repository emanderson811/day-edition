The Board authorized the use of $12,000 for this greenhouse at the meeting of July 9, 1929. The construction contract was awarded in September. 

This greenhouse was located north of Science Hall. It was a U-shaped structure with the bottom of the U facing Pammel Drive and the legs extending to the south. 

The structure was razed in 1969 to prepare the site for the construction of Science Hall Addition #2.
