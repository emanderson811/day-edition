Built: 1868-69 Burned: January 5, 1912 Architect: C,A. Dunham Contractor: N.P. Starks (construction foreman) 
This, the first of three "professors' houses" contracted in 1868, be came the first college president's house when President Welch moved 
into it in 1869.   The original plans called for the building to be of concrete block, but in September 1868, before it was finished, the walls collapsed and it was rebuilt with brick. The Board of Trustees, in March 1869, authorized the president to buy blinds for the house at his 
own expense. An addition was built in 1871. 
In the fall of 1879 the Welches moved to their new home, the Gables, and South Hall was made available to the departments of Botany and Veterinary Medicine. In 1880, it was modified for use by Domestic Economy. It was damaged by a tornado in 1882 (as were several other 
campus buildings). Not until the fall of 1897 was South Hall connected 
to the campus sewer system. South Hall became Music Hall from 1896 
until it was destroyed hr fire in 1912. 
South Hall was located on what is now Union Drive just east of the drive to the east side of the Memorial Union. It faced west with a porch across the front end. It was two stories high with mansard roof. The second story windows extended into the roof with dormers. A square tower-like element at the southwest corner added character to the house. Its style has been referred to as Italian in some early references.
