The Lodges 
Built: 1920 Architect: Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson Contractor: Thomas Sloss -Bldg. &Grounds Dept. Razed: Elm Lodge 1937; Oak Lodge 1938 
These bufldings were built on the site where Oak and Elm Halls are standing today. 
Increasing enrollments of women precipitated the need for additional housing in 1920. $130,000 was appropriated for the construction of the four units and the dining hall to serve them. To save both time and money the two-story buildings were of frame construction, with no basements, and were considered temporary at the time they were built. 
Other cost-savings were achieved "by eliminating closet doors, dormer windows, window weights, window and door frames, transoms. They (the architects) were instructed to use plain rafter overhang eaves. No shower baths to be placed on the second floor; tub baths to be in~ stalled ....eliminating the master key and thus effecting a considerable savings." (1) 
Construction was completed in time for fall occupancy, and the build ings were described in the Iowa State Student on September 27, 1920: 
An unusual record in dormitory construction has been made in the Colonial group of buildings that wi11 house two hundred and forty young women who are enrolled for school here this fall .... 
The arrangement of the buildings is unique. The four dormitories are connected by corridors in which are located offices and par lors and library. In the fifth building are located the dining halls and kitchens for each dormitory, re.ached by means of passage ways, all well lighted, and amply designed for larger numbers than the usual design. 
A feature of the construction has made it possible for amusement in abundance in the lodges. The dining rooms are so arranged that they can be opened into one large room, where recreation hours may be spent. The floors of hardwood, will make ideal dancing for the women, also.... 
All thru this new group, the architects have managed to give the entire inside an atmosphere of luxury and dignity, which is re

markable considering the hurried erection during the few 
summer months. 
Superintendent of Grounds, Thos. Sloss, who has had the work 
in charge declares that the accomplishment on time was only made 
possible by the use of student labor. In fact throughout the 
operation, he said, nearly four-fifths of the work force were 
college men .... 
The new buildings were officially named at the September 15, 1920, Board meeting when the minutes record: 
The two west dormitories to be known as Elm Lodge, the two east 
dormitories to be known as Oak Lodge,_the dining room on the 
north to be known as North Hall, and the entire group of tempor 
ary dormitories to be known as the Lodges. 
In September 1930, the Iowa State Student reported that $42000 had been spent on the repair and painting of the Lodges during the past summer. The following year adequate housing for women was provided elsewhere and a group of thirty men moved into the east wing of Oak Lodge on a cooperative aystem. A couple of years later 120 men were occupying the Lodges.(l) 
By 1935, principally as a result of the Depression, various government programs had been established on the campus. That fall these several offices were moved into Elm Lodge.(2) 
Elm Lodge was razed in 1937 to make room for the new Elm Hall. The College sold the buildings to J.F. Heable, a Cedar Rapids contractor, who removed it from the campus. At the start of his operation his crew went on strike when they were paid only forty cents an hour while the prevailing rate was fifty cents an hour.(3) 
Oak Lodge was razed the following fall, 1938.(4)
