A propagating house was built as an attached unit when the Experiment Station Building (Bevier House) was built in 1888.[^fn1] 

When the Experiment Station Building was moved in 1896 the propagating house remained. During the spring of 1897 there was consideration of a plan to move it to the rear of Morrill Hall.[^fn2] That plan was discarded and the building was razed in the fall. It was recorded in the November 1897 minutes: 

>We report the old greenhouse torn down, as ordered by the Board. The brick are piled back of Agricultural Hall for future use. The glass frames were sold by the President to Mr. Foster for $8.00. The grounds have been graded by Public Grounds Committee under the direction of the President.
