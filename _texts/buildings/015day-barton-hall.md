In the fall of 1914 President Pearson expressed the need for "additional women's  dormitory quarters."[^fn1] The following February the architect presented schematic plans for two dormitories, but it was not until the fall of 1916 that excavation was started for the foundations. Bids were received on October 31, but all were rejected and Supt. Sloss was authorized to construct the building.[^fn2] Work was completed in March 1918. 

From its opening until 1923 Barton Hall operated as a typical dormitory with its own kitchen and dining room for the sixty-five girls occupying it. In 1928 it became a cooperative hall and continued on that basis until 1943. From April 1943 until the spring of 1944 the hall was used by Navy Air Cadets.[^fn3] 

A major renovation was undertaken in 1967 from plans prepared by Savage and VerPloeg and under contract with James Thompson and Sons. Plumbing and wiring were replaced, the kitchen and dining rooms eliminated and the building was generally modernized and refinished. 

Known as South Hall originally, the name was changed to Clara Barton Hall in 1928.
