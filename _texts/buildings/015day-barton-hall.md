South Hall; Dormitory #3 for Women 
Contract: 1916 Occupancy: 1918 Architect: Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson Contractor: Thomas Sloss 
In the fall of 1914 President Pearson expressed the need for "addi tional women's  dormitory quarters."(!) The following February the architect presented schematic plans for two dormitories, but it was not until the fall of 1916 that excavation was started for the founda tions. Bids were received on October 31, but all were rejected and Supt. Sloss was authorized to construct the building.(2) Work was completed in March 1918. 
From its opening until 1923 Barton Hall operated as a typical dormi 
tory with its own kitchen and dining room for the sixty-five girls occupying it. In 1928 it became a cooperative hall and con.tinued on that basis until 1943. From April 1943 until the spring of 1944 the hall was used by Navy Air Cadets.(3) 
A major renovation was undertaken in 1967 from plans prepared by Savage and VerPloeg and under contract with James Thompson and Sons. Plumbing and wiring were replaced, the kitchen and dining rooms elimin ated and the building was generally modernized and refinished. 
Known as South Hall originally, the name was changed to Clara Barton Hall in 1928.
