An appropriation of $5000 was made in the spring of 1897 for Forge Shop and Foundry. Bids were received on June 30 and the contract was awarded for the one building in the amount of $3464. Professor Bissell was appointed local superintendent for the construction. 

The *ISC Student* described the building in August 1897: 

>The new forge shop and foundry for the department of mechanical engineering, the contract for which was let in June and which is to be completed in October, will be located thirty feet due north of the engine room, and will front east with it. The building will be eighty feet long by forty feet wide and the same length as the engine room. The roof is to be of slate, supported by strong steel trusses. On the north, large sky lights, together with many windows will admit ample light for the foundry, as well as add greatly to the general appearance. The shop will be floored with brick and will contain the forges together with all other equipment necessary for that work. In general appearances as to roof, windows and outer finish it will be similar to the electric light plant. (That is, the M,E. Lab.)

It was subsequently reported in the paper that work on the building was completed in December. 

The April 25, 1899, *Student* reported: "An automatic pneumatic hoist for the foundry is now under construction. Those who heretofore have had it in hand to elevate the coal to the landing of the smelting furnace will best know how to appreciate this improvement." 

The building continued in use as a foundry until that function was moved to the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in 1936. In later years it was the headquarters for the Technical Institute.
