Storage Shed -Service Area 
Built: 1926 Addition: 1938 Razed: 1972 
This building, parallel to 6th Street, was located with its center about on the east face of the north wing of the present Physical Plant Shops and Stores Building. 
It was built in 1926 after two years of discussion and delay. It was planned primarily to house vehicles and equipment for the Build ing and Grounds department. 
A reference in the College Controller's notes show a frame addition was built on the east end for $1200 in 1938. 
The building was razed in 1972 to make room for the new Physical Plant Building.
