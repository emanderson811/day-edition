The Biennial Report for 1906-08 expressed the problems of space for the Zoology department: 
The zoology laboratories have crowded into the basement (of Morrill Hall) and even to the window sills. The students posi tively cannot be accommodated if there be any increase, as there certainly will be according to the natural rate of growth. The trustees are nonplussed. 
Two years later the first biennial report of the new Board of Education reported on the Science Division: "A new building for this depart ment is a practical necessity." 
An allocation of $65,000 became available for a building for bacteriology and zoology (Science Building) in January 1915, and the Board architect was asked to prepare tentative plans.(1) The plans and specifications were presented and approved on February 3, 1915. The follow ing June the architect was instructed to prepare final plans and speci fications. At the September Board meeting it was reported that bids had been received, but all were too high. The architect was authorized to negotiate with the low bidder and a contract was awarded on the basis of certain changes from the original plans, including a substitution of Bedford stone for granite, plaster instead of marble walls in toilet rooms and reinforced concrete in lieu of structural steel frame.(2) 
An interesting description of the building appeared in the Iowa State Student on February 26, 1916: 
When fully equipped and ready for occupancy next fall, the new Iowa State science building will represent an investment of nearly $95,000, and will be without a peer in the country from the stand point of laboratory facilities and equipment. Four stories and a basement are to be included in the new structure which is 114 feet long by 50 wide. Absolute fireproof construction is used through out, the building being built entirely of concrete with red brick and Bedford stone facing.

The present structure is planned as a unit in a larger hall to be added to as conditions warrant. North light laboratories with 5 by 8 plate glass windows will give excellent lighting for micro scope work. The Ames architects have taken for their model, the buildings of the Boston Institute of Technology, on which over $4,000,000 have been expended. 
Bacteriology class rooms and laboratories will occupy the lower two floo~s while the top floors will be devoted to zoology, hu man physiology and embryology. The botany department will move into the quarters in Central building vacated by the bacteriology staff and the temporary laboratory structure at Central station torn down. A large basement in the new building will probably be devoted to the rearing of rabbits and guinea pigs for experimental work. Work in entomology and apiculture is to continue in chemis try hall. 
J.B. Evans declared bankruptcy and completion of the building became the responsibility of Superintendent Sloss. It was ready for use in the fall of 1916. Chang~ orders during construction resulted in, among other items, reinstatement of the marble in the rest rooms. 
At the time plans for the building were prepared it was known that additions would be needed, and the first request for funding such an addition was made in the amount of $100,000 at the February 8, 1923, Board meeting. By the time the Biennial Report for 1926-28 was issued the estimated cost had doubled. Two years later the 1928-30 Report showed a figure of $250,000 for a new wing to the building. 
It was not until 1947 that an appropriation was made for the Science Building addition and the architect was retained. In 1949 an addition al appropriation was ma1de. However, bids were not received until April 1951, and then all bids were rejected. New bids were received, on modified plans irt December 1952 and contract awards were made the next month. (1) 
During the 1970's remodeling of various laboratories and offices was required as new space allocations were made in conjunctiort with the new facilities made available in Science Addition #2. 
The latter building is reported separately inasmuch as it is a separate structure and not physically connected with Science Hall.
