Late  in 1903  the  Board of Trustees requested $75,000 from  the  legis  
lature for  a  new Creamery Building.  The  request  included  this  justi  

fication and description: 
The dairy interests of the State are second to those of no state 
in the Union, and our state annually manufactures nearly one 
fifth of all the creamery butter put upon the markets of our 
country; $75,000, is probably the least amount that would build 
a modern, well-equipped and substantial creamery building, suit 
able to the needs of the College for years to come, and a struc 
ture of an enduring and pleasing character and architectural de 
sign. A building of'this kind should contain a modern ice manu 
facturing plant and it should be connected with the central 
heating' plant of the College and the power obtained from the 
electric plant, thus avoiding the necessity of maintaining a 
separate ice-house and a boiler and engine in connection with 
the building. This building can be so constructed and located 
that it will be brought more prominently into the group of edu 
cational buildings on the campus and will present a pleasing view 
from every approach with no objectionable features.(1) 
In April 1904 the legislature appropriated $45,000 for the Dairy Building(2) and the architects were retained.(3) Bids were opened at the June Board meeting and a contract awarded in the amount of $43,192.(4) 
Contracts for plumbing ($3837) and heating ($2358) were awarded in No vember and $500 was allocated for electrical work by the College.(5)

The ISC Student, on Feb. 1, 1905, was able to report: 
The exterior of the new creamery is now finished. The plumb ing, heating and lighting is also practically completed and it is now ready to receive furniture and machinery. Our dairy students are looking forward with delight to the day when they can take up the work in one of the most complete and best ar ranged ~reamery buildings in the world~ 
In September 1905 the paper recorded that the building was complete and ready for use. The building is more fully described the follow ing month: 
....The outer walls of the building are of pressed brick, while the interior floors and walls of white tile, with the exception of a green border which extends about the upper part of rooms and hallways. The building is built fireproof throughout and everything is as sanitary as modern ideas can possibly make it. 
One of the most important and interesting of the many new fea tures to be foun.d in the building is the new refrigerator machine, by which different rooms may be brought to the freez ing point or below, as in the case of one room the tempera ture of which can be lowered to 10  below. There are four of these rooms for storing cheese and four for packing butter, the idea being to make certain tests as to the best temperature at which to store the above products .... 
On the first floor is a cream-testing room, wash room, toilets, lunch room and a laboratory for bottling cream. The second floor is given over to the testing laboratories and offices, while the third floor is taken up almost entirely by the Bac teriology department. The fourth floor is to be left for some time, on account of the lack of sufficient funds. There are also two rooms on the third floor which will remain in an un finished condition for some time for the same reason .... (1) 
The Biennial Report for 1906-08 reports the total cost of the project as $71,921.81. Dedication of the building was held on January 4, 1907. (2) 
The building continued in use for dairy activities, with some equip ment and machinery changes, until 1928 when the Dairy department

moved to the new Dairy Industry Building. Major changes were then made in the Dairy Building to provide "offices and classrooms (for use) by the Agricultural Economics and Vocational Education Depart ments."(!) The building then became known as Agricultural Annex. 
The fourth floor was remodeled in 1948 and the basement in 1955. 
The name East Hall was adopted in February 1961.(2) 
The East Hall Addition is separately described.
