In September 1918 _the YMCA was granted permission to erect a 30' x 80' building as a "Y" Hut for student soldiers. It was built the next month just north of the bleachers on State Field. (1) It was "Y" No. 2 with Alumni Hall "Y" No. 1. By the following year it was no longer needed for its original purpose and was purchased by the college for $1300 and moved to a site ;ust south of Central Station (just north of today's Library) with the east end close to what is now Morrill Road. It was then called "The House Studio" and used by Home Economics for laboratories.(2) 
"1925 ....North Studio ....was cut in half and moved near the present Dairy Industry Building where both halves were used as temporary agricultural laboratories. In 1926 they were moved to an area east of the Agronomy Building and became the Forage Crops Laboratory and the Genetics Laboratory. The Genetics Laboratory was torn down in 1935. The Forage Crops Laboratory was remodeled in 1950 for a Soil Testing Laboratory and was torn down in 1957."(3)
