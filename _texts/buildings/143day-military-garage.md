Built: 1931, 1941

The structure carried on the records under this name was actually 
three buildings. The first two were apparently erected in 1931 and were located on the west side of Winlock Drive, the northernmost unit west of what was then the south Military Stable (later Veterinary Sur 
gery), and the other unit across from the west wing of the Veterinary 
Clinic. 
Only those two units are shown on maps prior to 1942. A map dated 
that year includes a third unit, attached to the south end of the 
southern of the original two buildings. No references have been lo 
cated to indicate anything about construction of the third element.

tinues it at that figure until 1977 when a reduction to $188.06 was made to allow for the value of the original two units which were razed early that year. 
The remaining unit is currently used as a storage area.
