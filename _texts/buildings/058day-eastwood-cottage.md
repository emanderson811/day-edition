Farm Workman's Cottage 
Built: 1878 
Located just northeast of cemetery on open land. 
A one-acre farm site was allocated in November 1877 to L.L. Eastwood for a farm workman's house which he would lease from the college. In the spring of 1879 he was furnished wire and posts to enclose the acre of land. At the end of that year Eastwood was granted permission to remove his house from the college grounds, but he apparently decided against that action, because two years later he offered to sell it to the college. The sale was executed in the spring of 1882. 
Removal of the house was considered later but in 1888 it was being used by the Experiment Station. No subsequent references to the house have been found. 
The house appears on an 1883 map but is not shown on an 1896 map. It was apparently razed or removed sometime between 1888 and 1896.
