The first unit (east section) of this building was erected in 1919 as a poultry laboratory. It was 20' x 80' with basement and first floor, of brick construction. It's cost was $5836.33. It had first been re 
quested in 1910.(2) 
The poultry laboratory continued in use until 1965 when it moved to 
Kildee Hall. 
The Soil Testing Laboratory addition on the west end of the building 
was built in 1956-57. 
Soil Testing had been housed in the old Forage Crops Lab (see North 
Studio) and on the upper level of the Poultry Lab before the addition 
was completed, and has used the entire building since 1956.
