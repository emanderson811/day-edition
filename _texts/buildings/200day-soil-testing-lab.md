The first unit (east section) of this building was erected in 1919 as a poultry laboratory. It was 20' x 80' with basement and first floor, of brick construction. It's cost was $5836.33. It had first been requested in 1910.[^fn1] 

The poultry laboratory continued in use until 1965 when it moved to Kildee Hall. 

The Soil Testing Laboratory addition on the west end of the building was built in 1956-57. 

Soil Testing had been housed in the old Forage Crops Lab [(see North Studio)](https://emanderson811.github.io/day-edition/texts/buildings/153day-north-studio/) and on the upper level of the Poultry Lab before the addition was completed, and has used the entire building since 1956.
