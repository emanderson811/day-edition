This building was built as part of the development for the re-designed golf course resulting from the planned extension of 13th Street between Stange Road and Ontario Street. 

It is located on the north side of the course with access from Stange Road. 

The building was designed to reflect the architectural style of the apartments across Stange Road in University Village. Inside it provides men's and women's dressing and locker rooms on the lower level and on the upper floor a pro shop and snack area with vending machines as well as a large club storage room.
