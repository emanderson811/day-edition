Several different coal houses or coal sheds are mentioned in the Minutes, but little detail can be found. 
In December 1872 President Welch and Professor Jones were authorized "to construct a coal house for the use of the college at such place and of such size as they may judge most suitable for the wants of 
the Institutiori and charge to draw-back freight fund." 
The Aurora in September 1877 mentions "a large coal house" as one of 
the improvements during the month. Whether this was a replacement for 
the earlier one cannot be determined. The 1883 map shows a coal house just across the road west of the north wing of Main. In 1892 a bill of $30 was paid for "moving coal shed." At the same meeting the build ing committee was asked to investigate the ownership of the college coal shed and to sell the Mechanical department coal shed "if they consider such action desirable." (1) 
At the Board meeting in July 1895 a report was adopted "that the old coal house and ice house be torn down." (The ice house appears next 
to the coal house on the 1883 map.) 
A different coal house apparently served Morrill Hall at one time. In 1894 "The Pr~sident called attention to the desirablility of moving the old coal shed now located back of Morrill Hall."(2) At the same meeting it was agreed "that the old coal house north of the main building be torn down.fl That was undoubtedly a variant designation of the Morrill Hall coal house.
