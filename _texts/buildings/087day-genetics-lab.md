The Tenth ~iennial Report for 1926-28 included a Genetics Building in the list of needed buildings at an estimated cost of $100,000. The next Report, two years later was more conservative with a request of $18,000 for "A small two-story brick building." By 1932 the cost was established at $10,000,(2) but after bids were received in August of that year the allocation was increased to $12,000.(3) Construction started that summer and was completed by December of that year.(4)

tional laboratory space.(l) The west side of that addition was on line with what was then the west wall of the original building. There is no reference to architect or contractor in the Board Minutes so it may be assumed that the work was done by the Physical Plant Department. 
An addition along the west side, about half again the width of the original building, was made possible by grants from the Atomic Energy Commission in"l952. Those funds were related to research projects on the biological effects of penetrating radiations. The College paid only for the cost of the construction of the building shell while the federal funds covered the costs of all plumbing, electrical work and equipment for the interior. The work was accomplished under three sets of contracts and all were completed at the end of 1953.
