This building was located at a site which was about the center of the north wing of the present Physical Plant Shops and Stores Building. 

Authorization of a building for "horse stable and sheds" at a cost not exceeding $10,000 was granted in June 1924 and the construction contract was awarded the following month.[^fn1] 

The value of the building in 1928 was shown as $9500 and remained unchanged until the building was razed in 1972. 

This was a two-story structure approximately 32 x 44 feet with a one-story shed section 38' x 27'.
