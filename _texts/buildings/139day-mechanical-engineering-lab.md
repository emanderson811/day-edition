This building is composed of three units built at different times, but 
now  forming  a  single structure.  These units  are discussed under their  
earlier names  as  headings.  
MACHINE  SHOP  

Built: 1907"-08 Architect: Proudfoot & Bird Contractor: H.W. Schleuter 
The Machine Shop was the first part of the laboratory to be built and fciifl'!ms the west portion of the present building. Plans were pre pared early in 1907 and the construction contract was awarded in May of that year.(1) 
"During the construction of this building the board became convinced that much additional room could be obtained at small additional cost by building a gallery around the main floor." (2) An additional $1000 was made available for that construction and the building was completed in the summer of 190'8. 
STEAM AND GAS LABORATORY 
Built: 1913-1914 Architect: Proudfoot Bird & Rawson Contractor: C.E. Heaps 
This unit includes the east 120 feet and north wing of the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. The contract was let in October 1912, but construction did not start until the following spring.(3) The 125 feet high smoke-stack of radial brick was built in conjunction with the laboratory. The stack was razed in 1978. The building was ready for occupancy in February 1914.(4) This unit, too, had a second floor around the perimeter with a large area open from first floor to the roof.

ADDITION TO STEAM AND GAS LABORATORY 
Built: 1936 Architect: A.H. Kimball Contractor: Tames Thompson o, Sons 
This addition filled in the space between the two older buildings to make a single building for the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. It was funded with $20;900 of State money and $17,100 from the Public Works Administration. 
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY 
Since completion of the third unit the combination of the three struc tures in a single building has been identified as the Mechanical En gineering Laboratory. Extensive remodeling was undertaken in two stages between 1956 and 1961, 
The first phase of the remodeling was done in 1956 from plans prepared by A.H. Kimball and constructed by James Thompson and Sons. The Board Minutes of May 1956 describe the project: 
This pro;ect includes the construction of a reinforced concrete floor to close an open area between the second floor balconies in order to provide more usable floor space. It also includes a major repair of the roof of the building. The present roof is of a monitor-type framed with structural steel. The monitor windows are in bad condition, and it is proposed to alter the roof to a plain gable roof without monitors and to remove the win dows entirely. The roof is covered with cement tile which are in bad condition and permit considerable leakage. These will be re moved and a wood sheathing installed which will be shingled with composition or asbestos shingles. In addition, certain rooms in the north wing of the building will be finished for class room use by installing ceilings, lighting and repainting ....It is proposed to award contracts up to the maximum amount of funds a vailable, $40,000, but this amount of money will cover only the basic work outlined above. This must be done in order to make the building weather-tight and to provide a floor for future sub divisions into rooms. 
The above work was completed in February 1957. 
In March, 1959, an appropriation of $50,000 was made for further re modeling: 
This project will consist of remodeling to provide five more classrooms and to improve all of the existing classrooms in the building. The work will include construction of partitions, in stallation of plumbing, heating and ventilating services, re

wiring and installation of fixtures in the remodeled areas, 
painting, and asphalt tile floors.(1) 
Plans for this remodeling were prepared by the Physical Plant De partment and construction work was by that department "on a job order basis for individual sections as they can be vacated." (2) 
The final report, April ~962, showed a total cost of $51,757.86 ex pended on this second phase of remodeling.
