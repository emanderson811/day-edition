Plans for this building were authorized in March 1948 and a contract for the greenhouse construction was awarded in May and for the founda tions and headhouse in June. 
This original building was U-shaped with the headhouse and offices on 
the east side and two greenhouse wings built to the west. Funds for 
the project were provided by the United States Department of Agricul 
ture. Work was completed and accepted in February 1949.(1) 
The Iowa State Daily for August 7, 1953, reported that "The Department of Plant Introduction now has the glassed-in portion of its new green house completed" and that "work which was started last spring will be completed before winter." This proj~ct apparently was handled by the Physical Plant and enclosed the area between the two original green house wings. There is no mention of this work in the Minutes. 
The 1962 project was an extension westward of the north wing of the original greenhouses. It was funded by United States Department of Agricultur~ Regional Research Funds. It was completed in May 1963.
