The original building was built by the Agricultural Engineering depart ment as an experimental undertaking. It was described in the May 5, 1927, issue of the Iowa State Student: 
Construction work on the new masonry roof barn at the Iowa State Animal Husbandry Experimental Farm, which was started last fall has been resumed and the structure should be completed within the next two months, according to Prof, J.B. Davidson, head of 
the Agricultural Engineering Department at Iowa State, 
The novel feature of the barn will be the fact that no wood is to be used except for door and window construction. The shape of the roof will be what is known in structural circles as an inverted catenary. By use of this style of construction the roof acts as its own support leaving the room in the hay mow entirely free of the usual framing timbers. Even the hay mow floor is made of concrete which will allow for the storage of grain as well as hay, 
The idea of a masonry barn was conceived about 15 years ago by Professor Davidson. Shortly after that, his idea was partially carried out by the construction of one section of a masonry roof on a barn in the animal husbandry lot which stood for about 10 years, then was torn down. From much valuable information gained 
from experience with this section, plans were drawn and a one sixth scale model was built last summer by Bruce E. Russell, A.E. 
1 25. Following this college officials agreed to build a barn under these plans to be used by the animal husbandry experiment farms. 
From previous experiences it has been proven that the structure 
is sound as far as wind resistance is concerned; in fact in this respect it is stronger than a wooden barn, says Professor David son. He also states that the shape is satisfactory from the feed and masonry standpoint but the one big problem is to find some method of putting the material in place without spending too much 
labor on it. 
The barn is the first of its kind in the country, the plans having 
409 
been originally worked out by Professor Davidson and others in 
the Agricultural Engineering Department. The construction work 
going on at the present time is under the supervision of Henry 
Giese, an assistant in the department. 
The Financial Report for 1930 called this ;'Utility Barn" and valued it at $ll,600. 
Bids for an addition to the building were received in November 1954, but these were rejected, plans were modified, new bids were taken and contracts awarded in February 1955.(1) The work was accepted the fol lowing January.(2)
