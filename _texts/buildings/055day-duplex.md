Built: 1917 Occupancy: 1918 Contractor:. Thomas Sloss Razed: 1970 
Location: This was the center one of the five frame houses across the road south of the Power Plant 
Plans for a duplex house were prepared and submitted to the Board in April 1917 and an estimate of $4000 was made. Who prepared those plans is not recorded, but the description of them is of interest: 
Each department consists of four rooms and bath, with living room and kitchen on the first floor and two bedrooms and bath on the second floor. The kitchen would also be used as dining room. In the attic would be provision for storage and possi bility of fitting up as another room. The apartments would be heated by separate furnaces.(1) 
The Duplex was planned for occupancy by the Experiment Station Fore man and for the shepherd. It was completed early in 1918. 
Occupancy of the building continued through June 1970. It was then razed to make space for the addition to the Women's Gym.
