The need for a library and a museum was recognized from the very start of the College. The minutes of the Board in January 1870 state: "Next to the men that teach its students and to the men that control its affairs the library and museum are the most important means of building up a great insttitution." 

But it was twenty years later before action was taken to meet that need. The Legislature funded the building in 1890, and it was then determined to include a chapel as well as library and museum. 

On May 15, 1890, the Board accepted the preliminary sketches by the architects and their proposal to prepare final plans and superintend construction. Bids were received in July. At the same meeting the name "Morrill Hall" was adopted in honor of the Senator who sponsored the Morrill bill establishing the land-grant college system. Seven bids for general construction and three for electrical work were received. Contracts were awarded to the low bidder in each case, in the amounts of $28,404 and $335 respectively. 

The site for the building was identified as follows: "The center of the tower shall be due North on the east fine of the central projection of the Main Building." [^fn1]

The building was dedicated on June 16, 1891, with an address by Professor Charles E. Bessey.

President Beardshear prepared this description of the building for the 14th Biennial Report (1890-91): 

>The erection of Morrill Hall has enabled us to provide well for the work of zoology, entomology, and geology. For these branches of science it provides ample recitation, laboratory and depository room. The basement is well utilized by a flourishing gymnasium and rooms for the preparation of subjects of natural history and the display of fishes. This building makes pleasing accommodation for the exhibit of the museum and scientific collections in geology and natural history. We have provided a gem of a chapel that aids greatly in the social, intellectual and moral phases of our college work. The crowning service of Morrill Hall is its provision for a most admirable library room. The room is well located, cheerfully lighted and tastefully furnished, making one of the most inviting rooms of the kind in the state.

Fire escapes were added in 1904. The following year new seats were provided for the chapel and a barber shop was installed in the basement. In 1908 the barber shop was moved out to make space for a library reference room and office for assistant. 

Alterations costing $3249 were made in 1914, at the same time the Library was moved from Morrill Hall to Central Building. The Agricultural Extension offices and document room were then moved into Morrill Hall. 

Concern for the safety of the building resulted in an inspection by H.W. Hartupee, Structural Engineer with Proudfoot, Bird, and Rawson, in May 1922. He made a number of recommendations for additional bracing of the roof trusses, all of which were executed by Thomas Sloss, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, within the month. Subsequent alterations in the building were made in 1938 and 1955, and some minor modifications since then.
