This round, frame building was erected under a contract that included the Horse Barn (Landscape Architecture Building). It was built as a stock judging pavilion. 

An appropriation of $325 was made in 1911 for repairing and shingling the roof.[^fn1] The change in use for the theater-workshop came in the fall of 1931 as recorded in this account from the *Iowa State Student* on October 22: 

>After years of patient struggling and persevering hope, the Iowa State Players are at last going to realize an ambition. The gray circular horse-judging pavilion just east of the Landscape Architecture Building is now being converted into a player's workshop for practicing dramatic production. 
>
>In recognition of the importance to the college community of the activities of the Iowa State Players, Pres. R.M. Hughes began last year to search for room that might be used by the Iowa State Players, and this building has been selected.
>
>This is an ideal structure for its new use. It contains one large circular room, 60 feet in diameter and 12 feet high, with numerous windows and several skylights for lighting purposes. The large barn doors make the interior accessible on three sides and facilitate the passage of stage furniture and scenery.
>
>A new floor is being laid, the interior painted and a lavatory and deep sink for shop use installed. The building is steam heated and will have hot and cold running water. It is to be well equipped for night lighting.
>
>All activities of the Iowa State Players, except public performances, will be conducted there. Scenery will be built and painted, costumes made and fitted, experiment in stage lighting will be carried on, business, properties and makeup departments will meet and work there and plays will be rehearsed in this new location.
>
>Occasional programs of one-act plays will be presented to private and invited audiences.

[^fn1]: Minutes, June 1911 

>The classes in Play Production and Stagecraft, conducted by the Department of Public Speaking, will also meet there.

On February 9, 1932, the paper announced that the formal opening of the remodeled facility would take place that evening. 

Further remodeling occurred in 1936[^fn2]: 

>The entire inside has been torn out and the built-up stage demolished. The floor will serve as a foundation for the new rehearsal location. 
>
>Permanent seats have been constructed for the use of theater-goers. The new stage is so placed that better sight lines and lighting facilities may be recognized, as well as the use of complete sets of scenery now available on the 9 and 12-foot sets.

An inspection of the building in 1944 by the Ames Fire Chief and the superintendent of buildings and grounds resulted in a declaration that it was "unfit for public theater performances."[^fn3] It was not used for that purpose again until Jan. 23, 1947.[^fn4] 

A new concrete floor was installed over the old dirt floor of the basement in 1949.[^fn5] The building became known as Shattuck Theater in 1960 when a plaque honoring Fredrica Shattuck was installed in the lobby. She had established the Iowa State Players shortly after coming to the campus as an instructor in English in 1914. 

Further remodeling took place in 1960. 

The building continued as a theater-workshop until the new Fisher Theater was ready for use in 1973. It was razed in 1979.
