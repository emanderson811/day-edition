Plans to erect a prefabricated building for the storage of infrequently used books were first presented to the Board at the meeting of December 12, 1939. Bids for such a structure were received the following spring and the contract was awarded on April 5, 1940.(1) At the same time the Department of Buildings and Grounds was authorized to construct the floor and install the necessary mechanical services for the building. 
Authorization for the purchase of library stacks for the building was 
given at that meeting. 
The Daily Iowa State Student reported on May 17, 1940: 
Construction has begun on a $9,000 storehouse for least-used library books to be located north of the Insectary. The ware house will accommodate two stack levels of 80,000 volumes each .... ....Work on the building is being done by WPA laborers under
