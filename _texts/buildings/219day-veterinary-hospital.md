Located approximately where Pine Room is situated in Memorial Union. 

The original building is well described by Professor Stalker in his report included in the 11th Biennial Report for 1884-85: 

>The hospital is a substantial brick building, forty-five by fifty feet, and two stories high, with hay and other storage room on the third floor. There is a communication between the first and second floors by means of a nicely adjusted elevator, and also by a runway, with an easy grade by means of which animals pass from one floor to the other with greatest facility. On the ground floor is a large, well-lighted central court, where clinics are held, and surgical operations performed, Also a number of closed and open box stalls for the patients, office, harness room, room for heating apparatus, etc. On the second floor are single and box stalls, pharmacy, house surgeon's room, and a convenient dissecting room cut off from the other portions of the upper floor. All interior brick work is covered with alabastine, or plastered with hard finish. All wood work is neatly done in hard wood finish. The system of drainage is complete throughout the entire building. The J.L. Mott System of iron drain troughs with perforated iron tops and supplied with the well water traps is employed. The drainage pipes may be flushed from either floor. From a sanitary point of view, this is one of the best, if not the best, infirmary in the United States... A fine paddock of six acres lies just back of the hospital. This is set with mixed tame grasses and clover. There is fine shade and running water in this meadow, which makes it a very valuable adjunct to the hospital. 

The building faced north and the "running water" was College Creek. 

Within four or five years of its first use the building was in need of repairs and, in addition, it had become inadequate to serve the increasing number of students. In 1898 it was connected to the central water supply and the windmill that had served to pump water from a well was removed. Other modifications were made in the next decade. In 1912 the Veterinary Department moved to the new Quadrangle. 

The Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds took over the building at that time as a storage area for supplies and equipment for maintenance functions. Sometime between then and 1921 a frame one-story shed was added for additional storage across the west side of the building. It was during this period it became known as the Carpenter Shop. 

In 1926 the building was razed to make room for the new Memorial Union Building.
