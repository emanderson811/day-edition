Garage -Extension Service; Equipment Storage 
Built: 1931 
Some uncertainties exist in regard to the way this building has been recorded in the Financial Reports which are the only documents in which any information has been found other than on maps of the campus. 
It is first listed in the 1932 report with a valuation of $859 and carried under the name "Garage -Extension Service", and continued that way until 1939 when it became "Garage (8 cars)" in the listing of build ings allocated to Agricultural Extension. That same name and value con tinued through the 1958 report. 
In the 1959 Financial Report it was combined with the Equipment Storage 
222 
Building with a new valuation of $2359 and listed in Service Area. This was apparently an unfortunate error, since the building was not changed or added to then. 
In 1959 the building was transferred from the Service Area to the College of Education listing but retained the same valuation. 
It is this writer's opinion that the original Equipment Storage Build ing was remov~d in 1960 or 1961 to make way for the Genetics Storage Building, erected in 1960 or 1961, and that it should have been elim inated from the Financial Report at that time instead of combining it with the Extension Service Garage. 
Another building, just south of this one, and the same size, had been erected in 1944 and was identified on the 1955 map as Drivers Training Storage. It was razed in 1961.
