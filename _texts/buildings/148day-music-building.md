For many years the Music Department had outgrown Music Hall and had overflowed into several other buildings as well. It was not until 1974 that funds for planning a new building were made available and the project became more than a dream. 

In November 1976 the architect was selected and provided with the Building Program prepared by the University Architect. This would become the first building erected on the campus designed specifically to satisfy the special space and acoustical requirements for music teaching and performance. R. Lawrence Kirkegaard was retained as a consultant for the acoustic conditions of the building. 

Plans were developed and schematic drawings were approved in May of 1977. Final construction documents were completed in early summer of 1978 and construction contracts were awarded in August of that year. 

Occupancy of the building is scheduled for the fall of 1980.
