This women's hall project was initiated in the spring of 1935 with the retention of the architect, as recorded in the Minutes of April 15. It was planned to finance the building with a combination of a federal grant and borrowed funds.[^fn1] However, that grant was not approved and the full cost of the project fell on the borrowed funds. 

Contracts for construction were awarded on October 30, 1935, and the work was completed and accepted by October of 1936. 

Roberts Hall completed the complex of structures around Carrie Lane Court. 

The sculptured panel behind the fountain on the east wall of Roberts Hall was made by Christian Petersen and installed in the spring of 1940. 

In 1969-71 this hall, along with Birch and Welch, was extensively remodeled. Since then it has housed men.
