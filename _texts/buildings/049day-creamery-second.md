Located at the south end of what is now East Hall. 

Early in 1891 it was deemed essential to replace the old Creamery with a wholly new structure. The sum of $4000 was made available and construction was undertaken.[^fn1] The Biennial Report for 1890-91 describes what was accomplished: 

>The money already appropriated for creamery has been most judiciously expended, but the amount was not adequate to make sufficient room for instruction in all departments of dairying, and especially for the making of cheese. The foundation is in for an addition that will be adequate for cheese-making as well as butter-making. With small additional expense rooms can be fitted up in the second story of the creamery that will be quite con venient for the rooming of students. The second story adds much to the architectural effect of the building and affords room that will be quite desirable. 

An appropriation of $5000 was made by the General Assembly in April 1892 for completion of the Creamery. The work done with those funds was described in the Biennial Report for 1892-93: 

>The amount appropriated for the creamery and repairing farm barns enabled us to finish the dormitories above the creamery, put in cement floors, to finish the large work room in the creamery, a room and laboratory for the professor of dairying, and put the main part of the creamery in good working condition. The heating plant of the creamery was extended to the dormitory rooms, thereby affording them safe and convenient heating. 

The same Report, however, states that the building is still short of space. 

Between then and 1898 minor changes and repairs were made. 

In May 1898 a contract was awarded to W.M. Rich for an addition to the creamery and to the sheep barn for $1795. The figure is not broken down between the two buildings. 

By 1903 the Creamery was past its prime as pointed out in the Biennial Report for 1902-03: 

[^fn1]: Minutes, January and May 1891 

>The Creamery Building, as is well known, is a dilapidated structure and entirely inadequate for the present needs, and not at all in keeping with the dairy interests of a state like Iowa. This building is one of the first college creameries erected, and served its purpose in pioneer days, but we have entirely out grown it and aside from its deficiencies it is an expensive building to maintain and operate and an unsightly structure on the College campus. 

Authorization to wreck the Creamery was granted in September 1904, but subsequently it was used for an additional school term. It was finally razed in mid or late 1905.
