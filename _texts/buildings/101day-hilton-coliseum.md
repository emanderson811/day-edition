Fieldhouse-Auditorium 
Built: 1968-1971 Architect: Crites & McConnell and Brooks Borg & Skiles Acoustical Consultant: Paul S. Veneklasen & Associates Contractor: James Thompson & Sons 
The original plans for the field house were for a building quite dif ferent in appearance from that which was finally erected. Those drawings showed a structure with massive ribs supporting a roof carried by steel suspension cables between the ends of the ribs. Bids based on that scheme were received on September 8, 1967, but were rejected because they were excessively high. 
Revised plans were then prepared by the architects on the scheme wh~ch became the Hilton Coliseum. New bids were received on June 4, 1968, and construction contracts were awarded on the 13th of that month. 
Dedication of the building took place on ,June 5, 1970, while construc 
tion was still in progress. The fieldhouse then became the .James H.

Hilton Coliseum in honor of the university's President Emeritus and his concept of the Iowa State Center project which his efforts were bringing to fruition. The formal opening of the building took place on December 2, 1971. 
The size of the playing floor was established on the basis of require ments for a standard size hockey rink. Seating capacity is 12,680 when the full arena floor is needed for performances. For other occa sions seating on th~ arena floor with movable bleachers and folding chairs permits a maximum seating of about 15000. 
The $8,000,000 cost of the Coliseum was financed largely through stu dent fees and some additional funds from donors to the Iowa State University Foundation. 
Modifications were made in 1979 in improvements to access by the handi capped, increased exit facilities, changes in locker rooms, improve ments in the ventilation system, and expansion of storage and shop areas, together with a new exterior ticket booth.
