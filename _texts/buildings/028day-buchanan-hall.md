Graduate Student Dormitory 
Built: 1963-64 Architect: Brooks-Borg Contractor: James Thompson & Sons 
The earliest mention of a program to include a graduate dormitory appears in the Minutes for June 26, 1945, when $350,000 wa~ the. sug gested cost. The next reference was in 1949 when a graduate dormi tory was listed in the group of buildings in the "Long Term Future 
(after 1955)" but with no dollar value shown. In 1960 the Board gave approval to a proposal to proceed with development of preliminary plans for a building "to house 150 men and 75 women, with food service at an estimated cost of $1,000,000, wit.h the tirtderstanding that ap pointment of an archit~ct would be scheduled for mid-1961, bid letting in 1962, and occupancy in 1964.11 (1) 
It was April 1962 before the architect was selected, and February 1963 when bids were received.(2) In the meantime legal problems concerning the use of the property for the purpose planned had been resolved. Those problems are well recorded by Schilletter.(3) 
The building was completed and ready for occupancy at the start of the fall quarter 1964. 
In March 1965 the building was named in honor of Dean Robert E. Buchanan.(4) Dedication was held in June 1966.(5)
