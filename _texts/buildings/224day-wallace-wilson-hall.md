These two high-rise halls and the adjoining food service building are, in general duplicates of the first set of Towers. Some changes were made to remedy deficiencies which developed during use of the first buildings. 

The third tower, Wallace Hall, was started in the spring of 1966 and occupancy began in March 1967. 

The fourth tower, Wilson Hall, and the Commons went under contract in June 1967. It was completed in 1969. 

Wallace Hall was named for Henry A. Wallace who served as Vice President under Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1941-44. 

Wilson Hall was named for James (Tama Jim) Wilson who served the College as Dean of Agriculture from 1898-1902 and the country as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture for 16 years.
