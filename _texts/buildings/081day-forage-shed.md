This structure was just to the south of the frame Military Stables near Pammel Woods. 

The only formal record occurs in the Board minutes for December 13, 1922: 

>$2,700.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated from the Fund for Additional Construction and Equipment for the construction of a forage shed in connection with the military stable, and installing electric lights in this group of buildings. The college is under obligation to furnish buildings and up to the present time feed has been stored out of doors. The government furnishes horses, feed and men. 

The Forage Shed is included in the list of buildings in the Secretary's Report for June 30, 1928, but is not included in the 1930 list, so it can be assumed it was removed between those two dates.
