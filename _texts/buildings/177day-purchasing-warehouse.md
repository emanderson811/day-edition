Bookstore Storage 
Built: 1956-57 
Architect: None 
Contractor: Abild Construction Co. and 
Physical Plant 
Authorization to purchase two metal prefabricated buildings to be "used as storage warehouses for the College Bookstore, Inventory Clerk, Central Stores, and Physical Plant" was given at the Sept. 20-21, 1956, Board meeting. The buildings were to be 40 x 80 feet each. 
It was established that the foundations and floor would be built by Physical Plant. The contractor submitting the low bid for furnish 
ing and erecting the building proposed a single structure of 76 feet by 98 feet, with an alternate to omit one bay. That alternate was accepted. (1) 
The following June 6 the Iowa State Daily reported that the building was under construction. No record has been seen to determine when the project was finished, but it was probably late in that summer or early in the fall.
