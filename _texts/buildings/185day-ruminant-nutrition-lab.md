The construction of Horse Barn #3 was authorized and undertaken in 1929. 
Kooser recorded that the contractor was L.D. Anthony, that the work was done under the direction of the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, and that the project cost was $9900.[^fn1] 
In 1952 plans were prepared for remodeling the building for use as a Nutrition Research Laboratory, and the Physical Plant proceeded with extension of utility lines to the building. The actual remodeling for 
the laboratory was not started until about five years later when a construction contract was awarded in February 1957, and the work was accepted in November of that year. [^fn2]
