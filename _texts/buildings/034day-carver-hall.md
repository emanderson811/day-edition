Rapidly increasing student enrollments during the 1960's made additional classroom and office space a top priority item. An appropriation was made in the spring of 1965 and this, coupled with grants from the U.S. Office of Education (Higher Education Facilities Act) made this building possible. 

The original plans for the building were based on providing classrooms and two lecture halls for general use and to make adequate office space available for the faculty of the departments of mathematics and industrial administration. 

A change to provide offices for the Dean of the College of Sciences and Humanities was made in the plans before they were completed for bidding. 

In 1966, before construction had been started, the building was named Carver Hall in honor of George Washington Carver who had been both a student and instructor at the College before 1900, and before he had established his nation-wide reputation as a research botanist and chemist. 

A small statue of Carver, by Christian Petersen, is displayed in a case in the building lobby. 

Construction of the building started in September 1967 and it was ready for occupancy in December 1969.
