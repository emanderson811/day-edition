Classroom & Office Building #2 
Built: 1967-69 Architect: Durrant, Deininger, Dommer, Kramer, Gordon Contractor: W.A. Klinger, Inc. 
Rapidly increasing student enrollments during the 1960's made addition al classroom and office space a top priority item. An appropriation was made in the spring of 1965 and ~his, coupled with grants from the 
U.S. Office of Education (Higher Education Facilities Act) made this building possible. 
The original plans for the building were based on providing class rooms and two lecture halls for general use and to make adequate of fice space available for the faculty of the departments of mathematics and industrial administration. 
A change to provide offices for the Dean of the College of Sciences and Humanities was made in the plans before they were completed for bidding. 
In 1966, before construction had been started, the building was named Carver Hall in honor of George Washington Carver who had been both a student and instructor at the College before 1900, and before he had established his nation-wide reputation as a research botanist and chemist.

Construction of the building started in September 1967 and it was ready for occupancy in December 1969.
