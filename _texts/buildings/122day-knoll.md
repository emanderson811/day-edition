President's House 
Built: 1900-01 Remodeled: 1966 Architect: 1900 Liebbe, Nourse & Rasmussen 1966 Bernard J. Slater Contractor: 1900 C.R. Cushman (General) 1966 Carlson-Rockey, Inc. 
The need for a house for the president of the college was first ex pressed formally at the November 1898 meeting of the Board of Trustees when the Building Committee was asked to study the feasibility of construction and prepare an estimate of the cost. "The Gables", which had been rented as a home for President Beardshear, had been sold in 1898 and the president was forced to move elsewhere. 
At the May 2-4, 1900, meeting of the Board the Building Committee was "authorized to contract with Liebbe, Nourse and Rasmussen to prepare and complete plans and specifications for the president's residence" and established that it "be located on the knoll west of Prof. Knapp's residence." (1) 
Construction contracts were awarded inAugust 1900 in the amount of $10,067.75 for general work and $1850 for mechanical. An additional sum of $112.50 was authorized for the use of Omaha grey brick.(2) The building was officially accepted in March 1901, but the Beardshears had moved tnto it in February.(3) Mrs. Beardshear was permitted to remain in the house, after the president's death in August 1902. She moved to her new house (Lincoln Way Cottage) in 1903. 
New furnishings and carpets were provided and various other improve ments were made in 1904.(4) 
When South Hall burned on Jan. 5, 1912, The Knoll was selected as the best temporary housing for the music department. 
Superintendent Sloss is directed to put the President's house in shape for occupancy during the remainder of the college year by the department of Music. It is ordered that the rugs and other

fine furnishings be removed from the rooms to be used as class 
and practice rooms, and other suitable furniture provided.(!) 
This use of the house was possible at that time because it was during a period when Edgar W. Stanton was serving as acting president and the house was not then occupied. Before September the Music department moved to the Sanitary Building and The Knoll became available as the 
residence for President Pearson. 
A new bathroom was installed on the third floor and the "servant's bath room" remodeled in 1915. At the same time the main porch was pro vided with winter sash and also screened.(2) A garage was added in 1919. In 1919.a sleeping porch was authorized to be built on the second floor and the porch beneath it enlarged to accommodate the new construction. Apparently that was not undertaken then beca~se in March 1922 it was unanimously carried by the Board that the kitchen be en larged, a sleeping porch be constructed and the living room remodeled, all under the direction of Supt. Sloss. The financial report for the year shows an increase of $3,300 in the valuation or the house. 
The living room was enlarged in 1928 and the following year a new 
furnace was installed and new bookshelves built in the library. 
An allocation of $11,000 was made in April 1936 for repairs and reno vations to The Knoll at the start of President Friley's residence in the house. A new roof was installed, the house was insulated, the interior was largely repainted, new electric wiring and fixtures were installed, and improvements were made in the plumbing and heating equip ment. (3) 
In 1953 an extensive modification was made in the heating system for 
the Knoll. Plans and specifications were prepared by Brooks-Borg 
and the contract was awarded to Paul Titus, Des Moines, in the total 
amount of $13,453.(4) 
When the change in administration from President Hilton to President 
Parks was pending in the spring of 1965 serious questions were raised 
about the desirability of retaining The Knoll as the residence of the 
President. In March the Board of Regents asked the Campus Planning 
Committee to study and make reconunendations. That report is recorded

in the Minutes of the April meeting: 
'!'his report provides recommendation in answer to the following questions: (a) Is the present site of the President's re,sidence suitable and proper for its current and future use, (b) if it is not suitable, what functions should ultimately be located there, and (c) what interim use should be made of The Knoll in the event a different activity will use this area in the future? 
The committee examined the questions concerning the use of the site in terms of the President's personal convenience and the need of the University. For the President's personal and family needs, it was felt that the present site is inadequate in provid ing a proper degree of privacy and freedom. The close proximity of the women's dormitories on the east, the nearness of a major highway on the south, and the possibility of Union expansion on the west, all create problems and conditions which are not con ducive for a private personal and family life. For fulfilling professional obligations, such as recognition functions, lawn parties, faculty teas, etc., the location of the President's home is not critical due to the mobility of the people who attend these functions.   It was noted that some of these activities now occur elsewhere because of the inadequacy in the size or design of The Knoll itself, and the increasing numbers of people who must be accommodated. 
Since the site of the Knoll is strategically placed with respect to the overall campus plan, it has the advantage of being well located if the President's residence is to assume a ceremonial function. Such location may also have a symbolic meaning to some students, contribute to the feeling of a more "personal" campus, and represent the prestige of the University. These fac tors were not thought to be of decisive importance. 
Considering the University's long-range needs, the committee concluded that the site and its adjacent area are too valuable for continued use as a residence. The site is strategically lo cated and is readily accessible from outside the University. It appears to be best suited for one of the following functions: 
(a) administration and student services, (b) semi-pubiic facili ties such as an art gallery, bookstore, museum or Union expansion, or (c) a school of design, music or drama. Use for dormitory expansion was considered inappropriate because the amount of land would be insufficient for the next maior dormitory complex. Neither was this site considered a proper location for a classroom build ing. The accessibility for the public and the distance from ex isting ,instructional areas make it 1mdesirable for thj s use. 
Appropriate parking facilities must be included with any develop ment of this area. 
In the interim period, the Knoll can most logically be used for staff offices and seminar rooms to temporarily accommodate the needs of rapidly growing departments. 
As a final note, the committee pointed out that the site of The Knoll, including the surrounding area, is one of the remaining natural beauty spots on the campus. As such, they strongly em phasize that careful attention should be given to the overall development of this area. It is urged that any new facility, in cluding any expansion plans by the Union, be attractively designed to provide an attractive view of the campus. 
The Building and Business Committee of the Board studied the report and at the May meeting made this recommendation: 
The Building and Business Committee recommended that ultimately the site of The Knoll be used for institutional buildings, and that the University officials be instructed to explore potential sites suitable for a new residence for the President and report back to the State Board of Regents. On motion by Mr. Redeker, which was seconded and passed, the recommendation of the Building and Business Committee was approved. 
Study_of the question continued for another year, until June 1966 when it was decided to remodel the Knoll for continued use as the President's home.(l) Plans were completed and the contract for the remodeling was awarded in September 1966. President Parks had moved into the Knoll at the time of his inauguration, July 1, 1965, and he and his family put up with the many inconveniences during the remodel ing operation.
