Stock Judging Pavilion 
Pavilion 4fo3 
Built: 1911 Occupied: 1912 Architect: Proudfoot & Bird Contractor: Direction by Thomas Sloss Razed: 1972 
This building was erected as a Stock Judging Pavilion and used as such until 1925 when it was remodeled to a shop for the Building and Grounds department. It was the easternmost of two buff brick octa gonal judging pavilions located where the south wing of the Physical Plant Shops and Central Stores building now stands. It had two floors plus attic, and was 64 feet across. 
Completion of the building was reported in the September 5, 1912, 
issue of the ISC Student where it was said to be "the best fitted and 
equipped pavilion on the campus." 
It was the Carpenter Shop from 1926 until it was razed.
