Chemistry Annex #2 
Built: 1943-44 Architect: A.H. Kimball Contractor: Weitz Company Razed: 1972 
This building stood east of the Central Stores Building, about in the center of the court between the two wings of today's Physical Plant Shops and Central Stores Building. 
Some confusion exists in the 1943-44 references to this building in the Minutes. In the entries of that period it is called "Addition to Annex 1F2, Physical Chemistry Building." Nothing has been found to indicate a structure in that location to which this Annex might have been an addition. The building was U-shaped with the bottom of 
the U to the north. The west wing was 22 feet wide, the east wing 40 feet, with a 15 foot wide court between the two legs of the U. 
The contract to construct the building was entered into in December 1943 and it was completed in February 1944.(1) Funds came from the 
federal government. 
In 1953 the College purchased the Annex from the Atomic Energy Commission for $3,150.(2) 
The building was subsequently used for and became known as the Plumb ing Shop. It also housed the Credit Union in the southeast corner until that organization erected a new building. 
The Plumbing Shop was razed in 1972.
