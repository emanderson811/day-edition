## ELM HALL 

<p>Built: 1937-38 <br>
Architect: Dougher Rich & Woodburn <br>
Contractor: Ben Cole & Son </p>

About the time construction was starting on Roberts Hall President Hughes was already looking ahead to the need for additional women's housing. At the October 18, 1935, Board meeting he reported: 

While we hope to open another dormitory for women in 1936, there is every indication that within a few years still another dormitory for women should be built. I bring this up now not for action but for your information and to advise you that in my judgment we should begin this year to formulate our plans for the location and design of this building. 

It was January of 1937 before action was taken by the Board, and approval of the new dormitory was granted. The following month the architect was retained. Construction started in June 1937 and was completed and the building occupied in March 1938.[^fn1] 

Elm Hall was built on the site of the earlier Elm Lodge and continued the use of that name. 

## OAK HALL 

<p>Built: 1938-39 <br>
Architect: Dougher Rich & Woodburn <br>
Contractor: W.A. Klinger </p>

Increasing enrollments continued the pressure for more housing and in May 1938 another building project was authorized. A federal grant of $119,988 from the Public Works Administration was approved in August.[^fn2] Bids were received in October and construction initiated about the first of November.[^fn3] The PWA grant was increased by $2700 in August 1939.[^fn4] The new Oak Hall, named after Oak Lodge which earlier occupied its site, was ready for use in September 1939.[^fn5]

## OAK-ELM ADDITION 

<p>Built: 1964-65 <br>
Architect: Smith-Voorhees-Jensen Architects Associated <br>
Contractor: James Thompson & Sons </p>

A report on long range plans for the campus, in the December 10, 1960, edition of the *Iowa State Daily* said that "A connection will be made between Oak and Elm Halls on the north ends." It was 1963, however, before steps were taken to begin the project. The architect began work on drawings in March of that year and final plans were approved in December. Construction contracts were awarded in February 1964 and the addition was completed in June 1965,[^fn6] and occupied that fall. 

The addition was designed to eliminate the two separate kitchens and dining rooms in the halls and provide a single facility capable of 
serving 600 people. New student rooms were also provided. 

In 1968 a renovation project was undertaken to modernize the showers and other plumbing facilities. Brooks, Borg and Skiles were architects and James Tbompson & Sons the contractor for that work.
