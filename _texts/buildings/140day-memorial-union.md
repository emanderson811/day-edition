(The Memorial Union Parking Ramp is duscussed separately under the heading "Parking Ramp -Memorial Union.") 
The concept of a memorial to the men who lost their lives In World War I developed almost at the same time the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. Various ideas were suggested: a grotto, a piece of sculpture, a park, a gateway, a fountain, a union building.(l) Committees were formed and votes taken to establish preferences. It was not until June ,.1920 that a firm decision was reached by students, 
faculty and alumni. The Memorial Union then became the goal of an extended campaign to raise funds for the building. 
The site for the proposed building was chosen only after lengthy dis 
cussions extending from 1923 until April 1925, when the present loca 
tion was dedicated on the 22nd of that month. Other sites seriously 
considered were the knoll where Friley Hall is now located and the Mu 
sic Hall (Maples) site, now the new Music Building location. 
Selection of an architect created some discussion between the Memorial Union board president and the president of the college. That will not be discussed in detail here because it is recounted very adequately in Harold Pride's volume. 
Pond and Pond, Chicago architects were chosen by the board president in June 1923 and they worked with the board for the next two years. A short-lived, unproductive contract with James Gamble Rogers of New 
York came in 1926. The first contract with Proudfoot Rawson & Souers 
and acceptance of William T. Proudfoot's basic design came in May 
1926.(2) The perspective of the building published at that time shows 
the north side very much as it looks today, although it was not until 
the northeast wing was completed in 1965 that the front reached that 
stage. Mr. Proudfoot died in June of 1928, only three months before 
the building was opened to the public. Ground had been broken and 
construction started in April 1927. 
On September 23, 1928, the cafeteria line was first put into operation and the following day the Memorial Union and Alumni Association offices were occupied.(3) At that time the construction included the main five story section, the Great Hall with adjacent east and west sections and Gold Star Hall on the north. The two upper floors were left un finished until 1936-37 when Ben Cole & Son were retained as contractors to complete those areas for occupancy.

1936 also saw the installation of the organ as a gift from two alumni. The following year the fountain in the area outside of the north en trance was built with funds provided by Veishea Central Committee. However, it was 1942 before the Christian Petersen sculptured Indian women were placed on the four sides of the fountain. 
The west elevator was installed in 1937, a necessity with the opening of the two upper floors. 
By 1938 just ten years after the building was opened, the demand for more space had become acute. Three factors entered into the decision to build an extension to the south rather than constructing the north west or northeast corners at that time. These were the need for a larger dance floor, for more space for.the Commons dining area and the desire for bowling alleys. The only possible location for these facilities was to the south.(1) Plans were developed to incorporate the South Ball Room, the expanded Commons with the Pine Room and '39 Room, and bowling alleys in the basement. Construction began in the summer of 1938 and was completed the following February. 
When Gold Star Hall was finished in 1928 clear glass was installed in 
the windows because funds then did not allow for the planned stained 
glass. Harold W. "Pat"'Cummings, 1 18, was a stained glass craftsman 
and a veteran of World War I. He was selected to design and execute 
the construction of the windows and they were completed and the hall was rededicated on June 5, 1943.(2) 
The next construction work on the Memorial Union was started in August 1948. That project included a south extension to provide for 
eight additional bowling lanes topped by an outdoor terrace, and an 
addition to the southeast corner of the building, three levels high, 
making space on the basement level for a service area for bowling 
activities, on the ground level for dishwashing facilities and on the 
first floor for improved food service functions. Work was completed 
during the summer of 1949. 
Even before that project had been completed planning was initiated for the next addition.(3) This became the longest and most costly ex pansion project undertaken. It included the northwest corner construc tion, the west terrace, the Chapel and the Browsing Library. Construc tion contracts were awarded in June 1950 and work was started before the end of that month. It was "officially" accepted on the last day of

1952, but not fully completed until later in 1953. 
Plans for another addition to the building were started in 1956. This construction was for the bookstore and the Sun Room. Bids were re ceived and contracts awarded in April 1957. The Sun Room was first used for the 1958 Senior Prom and the Bookstore was completed in time for opening of the 1958 fall quarter. 
The northeast section of the building was part of the original design, but many years passed before that unit was built to complete the north 
front as intended from the beginning. In 1962 the architect was de veloping the plans for that construction, but it was the summer of 1964 before ground was broken. This addition provided space for three new dining areas on the main floor --the Campanile Room, the Regency Room and the Cardinal Room; on the second floor the Pioneer Room made pos sible an additional meeting room and display area; student organization offices and meeting spaces were arranged on the ground floor level. This wing was completed late iri 1965. 
Increased demands on the food service area and for the bookstore brought about a southeast expansion of the building in 1972-73. This unit extended the basement. and ground floors to the east, and also 
included new mechanical equipment space in a sub-basement. A service dock on the south side provided better truck access for the bookstore and other needs of the building. Additional storage and sales space was made available for the bookstore, a building maintenance shop was constructed and food service kitchen facilities were expanded. This wing was started in mid 1972 and completed the following year. 
The southeast wing had been designed with foundations to carry two additional floors. In 1978-79 those floors were constructed to com plete the wing. On the first floor a new dining area was added, known as the Gold Room, and office space was incorporated on the second floor. Access to the parking ramp was provided directly from the new addition. 
Through the years of its operation the Memorial Union also underwent 
various minor alterations and changes which have not been mentioned 
in this account. Most of those are well documented in Pride's book.
