Agricultural Engineering Addition for Industrial Arts 
Built: 1962-63 Architect: Russell and Lynch Contractor: R.H. Grabau Construction, Inc. 
An appropriation for this building was made in the spring of 1961 and the architectural agreement was approved in August of that year. Construction contracts were awarded the following March.(2) 
The building was designed as an addition to the northeast corner of 
the Agricultural Engineering Building (Davidson Hall) and was "to in clude woodworking, metalworking and electrical shops, wood finishing room, drafting room and offices. The addition will be used for in dustrial arts until a new industrial arts building can be constructed 
at a later date." (3) 
Work on the project was completed and accepted in March 1963.(4) 
Remodeling to the extent of about $10,000 was done in 1973.
