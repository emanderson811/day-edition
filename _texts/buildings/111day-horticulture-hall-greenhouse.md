Plant Propagation Building 
Built: 1914 Addition: 1978-80 Architect: Proudfoot, Bird and Rawson (1914) Brooks, Borg & Skiles (1978) Contractor: A.H. Neumann Co. (1914 Building) 
Foley Mfg. Co. (1914 Greenhouse) 
McHan Construction, Inc. (1978) 
The building originally called the Plant Propagation Building was designed as the southeast wing of a large Plant Industry building to be erected on line with Curtiss Hall at the northeast corner of the open campus area. This can be seen in a perspective drawing of the proposed building published in the April 14, 1914 edition of the ISC Student (and again on Nov. 17, 1914). Earlier a site had been se lected northeast of the chemistry building (Gilman Hall), but the final site was chosen as better for sunlight on the greenhouse and greater accessibility for a larger number of students.(l) 
A contract was awarded to the Foley Mfg. Co., Chicago, in July 1914, in the amount of $16,095. In September the A.H. Neumann Co., Des Moines, was awarded a contract for construction of the building, in cluding the basement and a cistern, for $26,654. The cistern was

described as 37 feet in diameter, 15 feet deep with a capacity of 
4000 barrels of water. An alternate bid for a brick exterior showed a deduction of only $520, and the decision was made to use limestone. 
Final acceptance of the building was taken on Oct. 6, 1915, and a formal opening was held for visitors on November 5 and 6, 1915. 
The addition to the west of the original building was started in 1978 and will be ready for use in 1980. An expansion of the greenhouse and remodeling of the existing greenhouse is part of this project.
