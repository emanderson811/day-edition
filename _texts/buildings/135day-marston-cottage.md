The third of the three original "Professors' Houses" was first occu pied by Profes~or William A. Anthony. He resigned in 1872, and his successor, Alexander Thomson moved into the house. He was there until he, too, resigned in 1884. During his stay he shared the house for a couple of years with Albert E. Foote and later E.R. Hutchins. The next occupant was General James Rush Lincoln who lived there from 1885 to 1891. From 1892 until his death in 1949, this was the home of Anson Marston, shared with Samuel W. Beyer, Mrs. Marston continued to live there until the house was razed in 1958 to permit construction of Helser Hall addition.
