The third of the three original "Professors' Houses" was first occupied by Professor William A. Anthony. He resigned in 1872, and his successor, Alexander Thomson moved into the house. He was there until he, too, resigned in 1884. During his stay he shared the house for a couple of years with Albert E. Foote and later E.R. Hutchins. The next occupant was General James Rush Lincoln who lived there from 1885 to 1891. From 1892 until his death in 1949, this was the home of Anson Marston, shared with Samuel W. Beyer, Mrs. Marston continued to live there until the house was razed in 1958 to permit construction of Helser Hall addition. 

The house was brick, with basement, two full floors and large attic. The back stairs were added in 1874. Major repairs were undertaken in 1904. The front porch was screened in 1913 and in 1923 a garage was built into the basement.
