Appropriations for two residences for professors were made in 1882. Bids were received in July with the bid for Osborn Cottage at $2490. An extra cost of $25 was approved in November 1883 for putting an extra window in the house. In 1898 Professor Osborn was reimbursed $87 for his expenses in installing furnace, grate, storm windows and pump. Five years later $300 was expended for heating plant and other repairs on the house. 

A temporary porch was built in 1914 and in 1920 major repairs and improvements were made. In 1924 an allocation of $100 was made "for the purpose of changing the shed north of Osborn Cottage into a garage and putting a sleeping porch above, and the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds is authorized to proceed with the improvements."
