Recreation Building 
Built: 1947 
The origin of this building is documented in the following article which appeared in the May 9, 1947, edition of the Iowa State Daily Student: 
The Pammel Court children, through the efforts of their fathers and the aid of the college, are going to have a recreation build ing. The building is located on the east side of Pammel Court just north of the Insectary. 
Students are doing the terracing and building under the gnidance of the Physical Plant Department. The college is furnishing the materials and paying for the construction. 
The main part of the building will be a barrack-type building 109 feet long. There will be three wings extending to the west, each 20 by 54\ feet. Concrete floors have already been laid. 
Last Saturday student,s of Pammel Court started removing sod from parts of the campus where construction is in progress. They have taken it and sodded all around the front of the building. The sodded area is about 8,400 feet square and will have a fence a round it, so that it can be used for an outdoor play area. 
In 1960 the building was remodeled and it became the Driver Training Laboratory and has continued in that function since then. That de partment occupies only the front and two north wings. The south wing was for many years a workshop for Panunel Court maintenance operations. A westward extension of the south wing was added to provide a paint shop. It is currently used for storage purposes.
