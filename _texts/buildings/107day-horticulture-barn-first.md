At the May 1881 meeting of the Board of Regents a letter from Professor Budd was read. He requested approval to purchase a team and "to erect a small barn to shelter the same and for storing tools, etc." The Board authorized the purchase of the horses but not building a barn. 

The following January the Board appropriated $202 "for the purpose of reimbursing Prof. Budd the amount expended by him in the erection of a barn for the Horticultural Department."[^fn1] 

During the cyclone of April 8, 1882, this barn was practically destroyed.[^fn2] 

The 1883 map shows a small structure just west of Horticulture Hall (Farm Boarding Club). That is in all probability this barn. 

In 1897 the Building Committee recommended "that the abandoned stable near the present club house near Morrill Hall be moved out for the service of the Gardener."[^fn3] The following month the Committee reported that "the barn north of depot has been moved to gardener's house near west gate at a cost of ten dollars. We recommend it to be placed in repair."
