On the map of the campus in the 1882-83 Biennial Report the Veterinary Hospital is shown at a location at the northwest corner of today's Library. On later maps it is identified as a barn. 

In the same report it is recorded that a contract has been awarded to F. Turner to build a veterinary hospital for which $500 had been paid. At the November 1883 Board meeting an additional $33 was paid to Turner for his balance. 

In 1885, after the new Veterinary Hospital was completed, the barn was transferred to the use of the boarding department upon payment by that department of $300 to the College Treasurer.[^fn1] 

This is almost certainly the barn referred to in the Sept. 1892 action of the Board approving transfer of the "bus house and barn" to the Agricultural department and approval of moving them to a new location. The following May the Building Committee was instructed "to act at once" to remove the "house and barn belonging to the steward's department, from the grounds set aside for the Athletic Association."[^fn2] The Biennial Report for 1892-93 reports that the two buildings had been "moved to a more suitable location and put in better repair and condition." 

It is thought that the site selected for the new location of the house was on the south side of the road near the west gate, but where the barn was moved is not known.
