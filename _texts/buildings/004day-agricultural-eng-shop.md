Farrier's Shop 
Built: 1923 Razed: 1962 
Very little is recorded about this small concrete block building which stood just north of. the east wing of Davidson Hall. 
It is shown in the secretary's report for the year 1923-24 as having been built in that year at a cost of $2457.44. It is carried on the finan cial reports from 1928 through 1952 at a value of $2400. In the 1953 report the value was increased to $3344 and continued at that figure through the 1961 report. 
The building was razed in 1962 to make way for the Industrial Education addition to Davidson Hall. 
No references to this Farrier's Shop have been found in the minutes of the Board or in the student paper.
