Located 100 feet south of Engineering Annex. Long axis east-west.

The contract for construction of the Carpenter Shop was let in May 1898, in the amount of $4,387. 

>In this department each student is supplied with a set of tools, most of which are new. These tools are kept, while not in use, in a pretty glass case just over each bench. Such tools as are not used much are obtained by checks, thus making each student individually responsible for tools used.[^fn1]

The building was listed as "Pattern Shop" in the Biennial Reports through 1932. In 1934 it's name became Aeronautical Engineering Labor atory, presumably with a change in function at that time.
