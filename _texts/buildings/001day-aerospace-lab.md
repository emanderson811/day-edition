Carpenter Shop, Pattern Shop 
Aeronautical Engineering Laboratory 
Located 100 feet south of Engineering Annex. Long axis east-west. 
Built: 1898 Architect: Not recorded Contractor: Zitterell & Atkinson Razed: 1973 
The contract for construction of the Carpenter Shop was let in May 1898, in the amount of $4,387. 
In this department each student is supplied with a set of tools, 
most of which are new. These tools are kept, while not in use, 
in a pretty glass case just over each bench. Such tools as 
are not used much are obtained by checks, thus making each student 
individually responsible for tools used.(l) 
The building was listed as "Pattern Shop" in the Biennial Reports through 1932. In 1934 it's name became Aeronautical Engineering Labor atory, presumably with a change in function at that time.
