The Sheep Barn was built on the site, now open, just north of the Antigenic Laboratory (Agronomy Laboratory). 
Prior to about 1921 many of the animals used by the "animal husbandry" department were housed in the area east of the buildings on the east side of Knoll Road, south of the physical plant area and north of Col lege Creek. It was then decided that animals should be relocated to the north to the area in the vicinity of the then fairly new Meat Laboratory, and steps were taken to effect that move. 
The Sheep Barn was one element in the new complex, and was described in the Iowa State Student on September 27, 1922: 
The new sheep barn north of the hog barns that were built re cently, will be roofed over this week and should be completed this fall. The front part and one wing are being built this year, leaving another wing to be completed in the future. Ani mal husbandrymen believe they have a sheep barn that is as near model as would be practical to build. It forms the northeast corner of a quadrangle of barns which the proposed horse barn will complete when constructed. 
The wing was added in 1925.(1) 
By 1969 the building was no longer needed and it was razed.
