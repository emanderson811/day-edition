The increase in enrollments following the end of World War II necessitated special provisions for single male students as well as for the married students in Pammel Court. To meet that problem temporary housing was provided by the erection of a group of metal barracks type buildings on the campus. The site was north of the Hospital (today's Student Services Building) and east of the Laboratory of Mechanics. 

The complex consisted of a central core unit oriented east and west with four wings extending north and four south. 

The Cottages, as they were officially designated, were sometimes referred to as "Silver City" but that term was also applied to Pammel Court, especially the original portion on the north side of Pammel Drive. 

The center core provided lounge and bathroom space for all residents and each of the eight wings housed sixteen men for a total capacity of 128 students. It was occupied for the first time in the fall of 1947. Unitl 1951 it was filled to capacity, but then it was used only as temporary housing. 

Three wings were used by Driver Education from 1951 and the following year offices for television were provided. Three wings continued as emergency housing for the Residence department.[^fn1] 

The Cottages were razed in 1960 when construction of Pearson Hall was to begin.
