Greenhouse and Controlled Environmental Center 
Built: 1966-67 Architect: Durrant, Deininger, Dommer, Kramer, Gordon Contractor: Wm. Knudson & Son 
The capital expenditure program for 1963-71 included $545,000 for Greenhouse and Controlled Environment Center.(1) In 1963 the project was scheduled in the 1965-67 biennium.(2) A contract with the archi tect was executed in August 1965.(3) That project was for a green house for Botany research. 
An appropriation was also made by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Forest Service for a greenhouse for their and university forestry depart ment use. The two funds were combined for a single project with separate buildings. A lease for the site of the forestry building was executed in late 1965. 
Construction contracts were signed in March 1966,(4) and were completed early in 1967.
