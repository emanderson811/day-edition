The capital expenditure program for 1963-71 included $545,000 for Greenhouse and Controlled Environment Center.[^fn1] In 1963 the project was scheduled in the 1965-67 biennium.[^fn2] A contract with the architect was executed in August 1965.[^fn3] That project was for a greenhouse for Botany research. 

An appropriation was also made by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Forest Service for a greenhouse for their and university forestry department use. The two funds were combined for a single project with separate buildings. A lease for the site of the forestry building was executed in late 1965. 

Construction contracts were signed in March 1966,[^fn4] and were completed early in 1967.
