Located ]ust north of Laboratory of Mechanics, where east part of Mechanical Engineering Laboratory stands now. 
The contract for construction of a new boiler house was awarded to 
W.B. Christy in July 1891, in the amount of $2849.(1) Later in the year $400 was appropriated for purchase of a boiler.

The Power Station housed the electrical generating plant as well as the pumping station and also served as a laboratory facility for Mechanical Engineering. 
The building was razed in 1912 to make room for the new Mechanical Engineering Building.(5)
