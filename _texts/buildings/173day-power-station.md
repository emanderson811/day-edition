Located just north of Laboratory of Mechanics, where east part of Mechanical Engineering Laboratory stands now. 

The contract for construction of a new boiler house was awarded to W.B. Christy in July 1891, in the amount of $2849.[^fn1] Later in the year $400 was appropriated for purchase of a boiler. 

A pump house was an integral part of the new water system designed by Anson Marston in 1896. That structure was erected as a westward extension of the Power Station in 1897 under contract with Jackson & Moss for $1330 with an additional $290 for building the foundations for and installation of the pumping machinery.[^fn2] 

In 1899 a new boiler was installed in the Power Station at a cost of $1109.65.[^fn3] Another addition and boiler were added in 1902.[^fn4] 

The Power Station housed the electrical generating plant as well as the pumping station and also served as a laboratory facility for Mechanical Engineering. 

The building was razed in 1912 to make room for the new Mechanical Engineering Building.[^fn5]
