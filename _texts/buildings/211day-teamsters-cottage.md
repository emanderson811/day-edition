Experiment Station Farm Foreman's House 
Built: 1890 Razed: 1970 Architect: Josselyn & Taylor 
Located where Bessey Hali stands now. 
The July 1890 Board minutes record an appropriation of $750 from the Experiment Station fund for building a house for station employee, located on the Northwest corner of the lot known as the calf-pasture. 
In the September issue of the I.A.C. Student there is a statement that the house was to be occupied by Capt. Speer and family. 
In 1900 the recommendation was made "that the Hoover house be refitted for Prof. Jas. Atkinson by diagonal partition, closets, etc., as recommended by Prof. Curtiss, but we do not favor supplying the house with bath room or furnace. 11 (3) 
The house was moved in 1915 to a site across the road from the power 
plant. It was the second from the west in the group of five houses 
formerly in that area. 
The Teamster's Cottage was razed in 1970.
