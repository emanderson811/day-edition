Herbert Osborn, in the 1894-95 Biennial report expressed the need for an "insectary and bee house" for the entomological section of the Experiment Station. However, it was 1903 before funds became available. In May of that year the Board approved a recommendation 

>That an insectary for the Entomological Section of the Experiment Station be built, provided the total cost does not exceed $1500.00. $300.00 of this amount to be paid from the college improvement fund, the balance from the Experiment Station fund.[^fn1] 

The Biennial Report for 1902-03 stated that "these agricultural buildings will be ready for occupancy by the beginning of the second semester in January, 1904." Those buildings included the Insectary. Construction cost of the Insectary was $1982, of which the Experiment Station paid $750.[^fn2] 

The exact location of this building has not been determined. In the April 15, 1903, issue of the *ISC Student* it was reported that the trustees "decided to erect in connection with the new greenhouse, an insectarium for the use of the entomological department of the experiment station." 

On November 14, 1910, the *ISC Student* reported: "The removal of the ramshackle building that stood just north of the greenhouse will add a pleasing touch to that part of the campus." Whether that building was the Insectary or the old greenhouse potting house is uncertain. It might instead have been the Fruit House(q.v.). 

No other references to the Insectary have been found and it does not appear on any known maps of the campus.
