A building for fruit storage was first requested in the Biennial Report for 1912-14. In September 1915 the Board authorized its construction. At the October 27, 1915, meeting of the Board the sum of $600 was appropriated and the proposed building was described: 

>It was understood that the walls of the shed will be constructed of tile and that the walls will be approximately 20 ft. high from foundation to rafters and the foundation plan will be about 12 ft. 10 inches by 30 ft. 10 inches. The exact location of the shed is left to the President of the College and the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings for decision.[^fn1] 

The location of the building is uncertain as it has not been found on any maps. The location in the "north experimental orchard" is mentioned in the September 1915 minutes. That would place the site north of the tracks in what is now west part of west Pammel Court. 

On October 28, 1916, the Minutes of the Board record the final cost of the building was $749.53. It was carried on the building list in the Biennial Reports from 1918 to 1924 at a valuation of $594. It can only be assumed that the structure was razed about 1925, since it does not appear on subsequent lists.
