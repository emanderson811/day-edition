Recommendation for this building was made in March 1914 and was approved. However, it was another three years before the project was funded for a total of $6350 of which $3850 came from the Serum fund and $2500 from the Small Buildings Fund.[^fn1] 

The building was located about in the center of the west side of the present Clinic Building. 

When the structure was razed in 1936 the student paper described its functions: 

>The rendering plant... has been used to take care of hog carcasses used in the production of hog cholera serum. It was equipped with vats, distilling apparatus, grinders, and other machinery relative to extracting from the carcasses fat which was still further processed into the syrup. Much of the machinery was transferred to the Chemical Engineering Building where it will be utilized for the manufacture of wallboard. During recent years, the building was also pressed into service as an emergency laboratory and for the performing of post mortems on large animals.[^fn2]
