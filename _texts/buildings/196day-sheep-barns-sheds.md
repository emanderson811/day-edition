Various structures have been erected on the campus and designated as Sheep Barns, Sheep Houses or Sheep Sheds. The locations of these different buildings are not always identified with any degree of certainty. 
The earliest reference found occur~ in the Minutes for March 23-24, 1865, wherein "the committee recommends "a modle sheep house for the accomodation of six breeds of two each, also a fatning pen for mutton sheep." (Spellings as originally written.) 
Apparently the first shelters were built in 1867 as described in the Farm Superintendent's report included in the Minutes on .January 13 17, 1868: 
From lumber that had been used about the brick yard I had 3 sheep houses or sheds erected 24 feet by 12 each with double board roofs of sound lumber, each having access to an open yard for air arid exercise yet so constructed that the different lots can be kept apart from each other. The work all done by farm hands. Cost for'nails $10.00. 
In 1882 "Prof. Knapp submitted to the Board bills paid by him for the erection of the present sheep barn" The Board ordered that $71. 94 be appropriated from the State Appropriation for Sheep barns to pay the bills. (1) 
A year later the Board "ordered that upon completion of the sheep barns" the remaining balance in the appropriation be transferred to another account. This may refer to the 1882 barns or to new ones.(2) At the same meeting it was "ordered that the proposition of V. Tom linson herewith submitted to erect sheep barns for the sum of $415.00 be accepted." 
An 1883 map shows two buildings 'called sheep barns located in the area where the Food Technology Building stands now. 
By 1897 further action had become necessary as recorded in the Minutes for November 16-19: 
We recommend an  appropriation of $600 for removing and remodeling the old sheep barn, the sheep shed and barn now being decayed and very discreditable in appearance and unworthy of a state institu tion.

A contract for "the addition and alteration to the sheep barn11 was executed with W.M. Rich in June 1898.(1) That building was razed in 1927. 
Three sheep sheds were built in the pasture north of the North Western railroad (to the east of what is now Hawthorn Court). The 1940 Fi nancial Report shows the date of acquisition of two of them as 1911. The third had been destroyed by fire in 1938, but was probably built at the same time. The other two burned in 1959 under strong sus picions of arson. 
The Sheep Barn built in 1922 is separately covered. 
The Financial Reports from 1940 to 1959 show another Sheep Barn, pre sumably replacing the one lost in 1938. This newer building, valued at $1912 was written off in 1959, perhaps another fire loss of that year.
