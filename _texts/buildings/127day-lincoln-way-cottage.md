Located on north side of Lincoln Way, second lot east of Knoll Road. 

Mrs. Beardshear was granted a building site for her home in November 1902, under the same terms and conditions established for Dr. Cessna. (See Kildee Cottage.) 

In April, 1903, it was reported that "the foundation brick for Mrs. Beardshear's house are on the grounds and work is to be begun soon." [^fn1]

In 1914 the college expressed the desire to buy the house from Mrs. Beardshear. She set a value of $8000 on it and the sale was made.[^fn2] 

Remodeling was undertaken the following year and the house became known as East Hall Annex, a women's residence hall. (1915-21) During 1918 it was an emergency hospital for women.[^fn3] From 1919 on it was called Lincoln Way Cottage. The Sloss family lived there briefly in 1925. Until 1944 it served variously for different student groups and in some years as a tenant house. 

From 1944 until 1972 it housed residence hall employees. It was razed in 1973.
