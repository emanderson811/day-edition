This building was needed and designed to replace the functions of the old Meat Laboratory, built in 1916-18, which could no longer meet health standards and was very much outmoded and outgrown. 

An appropriation to fund this building was made by the 65th General Assembly (1973-74), under heavy pressure from the Iowa Cattlemen's Association. An additional appropriation was also granted in the next biennium to cover increased costs due to escalation and more complex mechanical equipment than was anticipated in the original estimates. 

The building program had been prepared in the early months of 1974 and was ready to present to the architect in May of that year when the architect and his consultant were selected. The very specialized nature of the operations of the laboratory demanded the need for a consultant with a detailed knowledge of and experience with the kinds of processes and equipments to be designed. 

Schematic drawings were approved in September 1974, but final documents were not completed for another year. Bids were received and contracts for construction were awarded in November 1975.
