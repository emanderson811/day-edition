This building is located off-campus in Boone County, near Moingona, on land acquired specifically for the needs of the observatory functions in 1967. In April 1968 the project description was recorded in the Board minutes: 

>The scope of the project has been enlarged to provide space for the radio-telescope research operations of the Department of Electrical Engineering in addition to the visual telescope research operations of the Physics Department. 
>
>When completed, the Observatory Building will contain the telescope and associated equipment provided in part by a gift to the University by Robert L. Mather and in part by an NSF Equipment Grant in the amount of $60,000, and will also contain computer equipment with an original value of approximately $1,000,000 which will be used in support of the radio-telescope research operations. 

The construction contract was awarded in November 1968 and work was completed in February 1970. 

In November 1970 the Board named the new building Erwin Fick Observatory, honoring Erwin Fick "who has demonstrated strong interest in astronomy and in the University. Mr. Fick, a native Iowan, now residing in Davenport, is retired from service in the U.S. Corps of Engineers. He devotes considerable time to refractor and reflector telescopes. He established a trust with Iowa State University Foundation that has grown to a substantial 5-figure amount, and he has deeded his home to the Iowa State University Foundation."[^fn1]
