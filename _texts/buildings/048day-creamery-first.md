Farm Foreman's Cottage, Teamster's Cottage No. 1 
Built: 1879 Addition: 1882 Remodeled and mdved: 1891 Razed: 1927 
Originally located across the road east of the Farm House. 
The decision to operate a creamery on the College farm was made in late 1878 and an appropriation of $300 was provided the following spring, with the funds to be paid from sales of wood and lumber from the farm. The 1878-79 Biennial Report describes the building: 
A neat and convenient creamery building, sixteen by twenty-four feet, has been erected without cost to the State. All the nec essary apparatus, including an engine and boiler, churn, butter worker, Cooley creamer, milk-vat, cans, buckets, etc., have been supplied at a cost of $379.50. 
In 1882 a creamery, ice house and cold storage building was erected with $1000 appropriated by the legislature. This was apparently an addition to the original building. Plans were prepared by a Prof. Bellanger of Des Moines. 
The 18th Biennial Report (1888-89) reported: "The creamery has been pronounced by some of the best dairymen in the state to be entirely unfit for our purposes. There is surely no inducement for a student to pursue the study of dairying there." 
In 1891 the Creamery was moved east a few yards and remodeled for the farm foreman's residence. It also served as a boarding house for farm workmen. 
It was razed in 1927 to make way for the new Dairy Industries Building.
