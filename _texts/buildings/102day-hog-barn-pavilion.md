This building was situated on the site where the Seed Laboratory is located now. 
The original request for this building was made by President Pearson 
in May 1921 when he recommended that $20,000 be made available for a Hog Barn and Judging Pavilion.(l) The requested funds were made a vailable in July and the site was determined in September of that year. (2) 
By October the site had been prepared by leveling and grading.(3) The building was described in the November 28, 1921, issue of the student 
paper.

The hogs that are being fed on dry lots north of the tracks now will be mo .red and the land used in development of a new pure bred hog plant. This plant will have as its center the new swine barn and pavilion, the cost of which will be $20,000. This barn will be built of hollow tile with matted surface and will have sunlight roofs. One wing of the house will run north and south with windows on the east and west sides. The other wing will run east with a south slope and continuous windows. This arrange ment will be of advantage both on account of centralization and also for the value of a comparison of the types of roofs. There will also be a large judging pavilion in connection with the swine barns and much of the swine husbandry work will be given there. 
The move into the new building was made in.February 1922. (1) It was August of 1923, however, before provisjons were made for heating the building. (2) 
The east wing of the structure was razed in 1969 and the balance of the building was removed in 1976 to make way for the new Seed Labora tory.
