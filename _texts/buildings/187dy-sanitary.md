Built: 1884-5 Remodeled: 1900 Architect: Foster & Liebbe (1884) Contractor: V. Tomlinson (1884) Razed: 1927 
Located about 200 feet northwest of the northwest corner of Mem orial Union. 
"Prominent among the urgent necessities I have mentioned, is a college hospital for sick students ....We believe that we could secure the Col lege from the inroads of the various infections if we had the means of isolating the patient so that we could at once disinfect his room. A college hospital, which could be built at limited expense would thus enable us, in nearly all cases, to save the suffering, if not the lives, of the young people cotmnitted to our charge."(1) 
Funds were made available in the following year, 1884, when plans were prepared and contract for construction was awarded at a cost of $4000. 
The hospital facilities were located on the second floor of the build 
ing with the first floor allocated for use by the Veterinary Department for theoretical classwork. This use prevailed until 1893 when the Veterinary Department moved into Botany Hall (then Agricultural Hall), 
and the Sanitary Building was used exclusively as a hospital. 
In 1900 a remodeling project was undertaken. General work was by C.R. Cushman for a sum of $1795. Two furnaces were installed by Lennox Machine Co. for $365 and L.H. Kurtz did the plumbing and gas fitting 
for $600. The work accomplished was described in the Biennial Report 
of 1900-01:

The building for the college hospital has been entirely rearranged during the biennial period and put in a much improved condition. The space has been enlarged by the change; the heating facilities have been made adequate; a nurse and cook provided, and a general homelike atmosphere created throughout the building. 
On January 1, 1902, the hospital caught fire from an over-heated air pipe from the furnace. The fire was extinguished by the college fire department. Repa~rs and repainting were completed in time for the re opening of school in February at a total cost of $384.34. 
In 1907 the hospital functions were moved to West Boarding Cottage. The following year, after some remodeling, the Sanitary Building be came a sub-faculty rooming house. In 1912, when South Hall burned, the Music Department was moved to the Sanitary Building which then became Music Hall. It served in that capacity until 1927 when the building was razed. 
Sanitary Hall was a two-story frame building with a third floor small square tower at the front, topped by a sharp pyramidal roof. There was also a basement under about three fourths of the building.
