Discussion of need for a new horse barn was expressed as early as 1891 when the first request was submitted for funds. Other askings went to the legislature in 1895 and 1897. In 1899 a request was submitted for $10,000 for horse barn and live stock judging arena.[^fn1] The General Assembly, in 1900, appropriated $12,000 for the two buildings. 

First bids were taken on May 2, 1900, but all were rejected because they exceeded the budget. Some revisions were made in the plans and new bids received on May 11. The contract for general construction of the Horse Barn and Judging Pavilion was awarded to Main and McKee for $13,555. Contracts were awarded two months later for the mechanical and electrical work totalling $707.50. The building served as a horse barn for almost thirty years. 

In January of 1930 an appropriation of $18,000 was made to remodel the structure to be used as headquarters for Landscape Architecture. A contract was entered into with Tapager Construction Company of Albert Lea, Minnesota, in the amount of $15,526. Their work was accepted in October of that year.[^fn2] 

The building continued in use by Landscape Architecture until 1978 when that department moved to the new College of Design. It is currently being used for agronomy and journalism overflow.
