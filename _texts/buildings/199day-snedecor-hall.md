Service Building 
Built: 1938-39 Addition: 1960-61 Architect: 1938 Thorwald Thorson 1960 Russell & Lynch Contractor: 1938 Harlan Contracting Co. 1960 Carlson-Rockey, Inc. 
Construction of a building to house various service functions of the college was authorized by the Board in July 1938, sub;ect to obtaining a 45% grant from the Public Works Administration. Those services were itemized in the Iowa State Daily Student on September 20, 1938: 
Housed in the new structure will be the mimeograph machines now in the basement of Morrill Hall; visual instruction and film storage which now occupies part of the first floor of Engineering Hall; the statistical laboratory now located on the top floor of Beardshear Hall; Station WOI, which is now located in Engineering Annex; the photographic studio now on the first floor of Agricul tural Hall and offices for the equipment and inventory clerks. 
An agreement with the architect was reached in August 1938, the grant was approved, bids were received on November 23, and construction work started by December 1. 
By the fall of 1939 the building was ready for occupancy, and the con tracts were accepted as completed in November of that year.(1) 
Long range planning during the years 1945-47 made references to an addition on the south of the Service Building, but it was 1959 before the project was activated, when the architect was retained in October. The building became ready for use in the surmner of 1961. A National Science Foundation Grant of $4300 had been received to defray a small part of the construction cost.

In 1964 the studios and other facilities of WOI moved to the new Communications Building, thus freeing the third floor of the Service Building for other use. A remodelling project resulted with planning and design by the Physical Plant and with Carlson-Rockey, Inc. as general contractor. A grant of $26,600 from the National Science Foundation paid for approxiamtely fifty percent of the project cost.(1) 
The Service Building became Snedecor Hall in November 1969, named for Professor George Waddel Snedecor.
