Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory 
Built: 1954-56 Architect: Dougher, Rich & Woodburn Contractor: W.A. Klinger Co. 
The first reference to the Diagnostic Laboratory appeared in the Iowa State Student on June 7, 1928, as follows: 
A new diagnostic laboratory has been installed in the basement 
of the Pathology Department of the Veterinary building for the 
purpose of examining the large numbers of specimens that are sent 
into the department for diagnosis. 
The new laboratory includes four rooms, the waiting and reception room, the animals room, the bacteriology room, and the post mortem room. The equipment has not all been installed but the laboratory will be ready for use by next fall. 
From an average of fity towns there are at least 375 specimens sent weekly into this department for free diagnosis. These speci mens include all kinds of livestock and poultry, especially baby chicks, cattle,swine, and sheep. A large number of dogs are sent in on the assumption that they have rabies. 
Funds for a new facility were included in the appropriations made in 
1945 and 1947, and in the latter year the architect was selected. Fi 
nal plans were approved in July 1950.(1) Bids were received in Septem 
ber but were rejected. New bids were taken in 1951, but again were re 
jected. The site at that time was on the north side of the Veterinary Clinic. In 1953 the decision was reached to change the site to the Quadrangle area.(2) A new appropriation, totalling $600,000 had been made that year. 
Construction contracts, based on new plans and the new site, were a warded in November 1954.(3)

(3)  Minutes,  December  9-10,  1954  

During construction of the new facility Dean I.A. Merchant was quoted in the paper as follows: 
The present building is so crowded that the new addition will be completely used as soon as it is finished. It is a good example of building for crowded conditions of the past rather than ex pansion of the future, but the laboratory should be adequate for diagnostic services for a number of years.(l) 
The building was accepted as complete in May 1956.
