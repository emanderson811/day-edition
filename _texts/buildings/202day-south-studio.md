Located about 50 feet north of east wing of Library and extending to within a few feet of Morrill Road. 

Destruction by fire of the old Chemical and Physical Laboratory in March 1913 resulted in the construction of a new building on an emergency basis. $7000 was appropriated from the Repair and Contingent Fund in July and by late September the building was ready for use.[^fn1] 

It was a frame building 32 feet wide by 106 feet long. It was described as "A temporary wooden shed of the cheapest construction possible .... it has been allowed to remain although it is not as well built a structure as many a barn or cheap warehouse in the State."[^fn2] 

With completion of the new Chemistry Building (Gilman Hall) in 1914, South Studio was remodelled for Plant Physiology and Zoology laboratories.[^fn3] The following spring its use was assigned to the Home Economics department who continued to use it until it was torn down in 1925.[^fn4]
