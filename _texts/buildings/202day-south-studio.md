Emergency Chemistry 
Built: 1913 Designed by: Supt. Sloss and Professor Coover Built by: Thomas Sloss Razed: 1925 
Located about 50 feet north of east wing of Library and extend 
ing to within a few feet of Morrill Road. 
Destruction by fire of the old Chemical and Physical Laboratory in March 1913 resulted in the construction of a new building on an emer gency basis. $7000 was appropriated from the Repair and Contingent Fund in July and by late September the building was ready for use.(1) 
It was a frame building 32 feet wide by 106 feet long. It was de scribed as "A temporary wooden shed of the cheapest construction pos sible .... it has been allowed to remain although it is not as well built a structure as many a barn or cheap warehouse in the State."(2) 
With completion of the ne~ Chemistry Building (Gilman Hall) in 1914, 
South Studio was remodelled for Plant Physiology and Zoology labora 
tories.(3) The following spring its use was assigned to the Home Eco 
nomics department who continued to use it until it was torn down in 
1925.(4)
