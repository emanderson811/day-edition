Child Nursery Annex Nurses' Home 
Built: 1901 Razed: 1948 (1949) 
This house was built by Professor S.W. Beyer on a site north of the Marston Cottage. It stood at a point about at the center of the court 
formed by the southern two east wings of today's Helser Hall. 
In 1910 a request was made by Beyer to erect a barn near his house. The question was "referred to Supt. Sloss with power to grant such permission if in his judgment deemed advisable."(2) It seems doubt 
ful that the barn was built because there is no subsequent reference 
to it and it does not appear on a 1915 map. 
The College purchased the house from Professor Beyer in 1924. It was 
the last privately owned house on the campus. It was purchased for $9,000 and title transferred January 1, 1925.(3) 
In 1925 the house was moved to a location at a point where today's 
driveway to the west dock of Spedding Hall is located. It was then 
used as a Nurses' Home and later, from 1930-48 served as the Child Nursery Annex. 
A contract to raze and remove the house was entered into on December 15, 1948, with the American Lumber and Wrecking Company, Des Moines.(4)
