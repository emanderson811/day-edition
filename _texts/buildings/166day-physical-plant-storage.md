This prefabricated metal building was erected to provide storage space for equipment used by the Physical Plant, particularly grounds main tenance machines. It also houses supplies of materials used in main tenance operations. 

Prior to construction of this building many tractors, snow plows, street cleaners and similar pieces of major equipment were kept in the open where they were exposed to the elements and consequently subject to more rapid deterioration. The enclosed space also ensures easier starting of motors in cold weather.
