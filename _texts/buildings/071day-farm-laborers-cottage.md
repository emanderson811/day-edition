Leighton House, McKay House 
Located at about present main entrance to East Hall Addition. 
Built: 1882 Architect: Professors Knapp and Budd Removed: 1904 
The Trustees acted to initiate construction of two farm cottages at their May 1882 meeting. The Board 
Ordered, that Professors Kanpp and Budd be appointed a committee to construct the laborers cottages for farm and horticultural departments, making their own plans and specifications, purchas ing all materials, employing the necessary labor and superin tending the work. Ordered further, that the sum of $1700 or so much thereof as may be necessary be appropriated from the State Fund for the erection of these cottages, the same to be divided as evenly as possible and practicable between the two cottages and to be extended under the direction of the committee, dupli cate bills of all expenditures to be made out and audited in usual form previous to payment.(1) 
New siding was installed and the house was painted in 1895. "As to internal repairs, it is recommended that Mr. McKay advance money for 
the same, such repairs to be made under direction of the Building Committee, and to be paid from repair fund when its condition will warrant."(2) 
Further repairs and improvements were made the following year under contract with E.C. Potter. 
First occupant of the house was William Pierce. Fred Leighton lived there 1892-94 and from 1894 to 1904 it was the home of Professor G.L. McKay.(3) 
In 1904 the house had to be moved to permit construction of the new creamery (East Hall). It was sold and removed from the campus.
