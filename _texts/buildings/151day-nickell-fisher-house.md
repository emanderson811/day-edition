~uplex "B" -Genevieve Fisher House 
Built: 1951 -52 Architect: Griffith & Haines Contractor: James Thompson & Sons 
This building was constructed under the same contracts as the Child Development Building. Both were built as Home Management houses and 
financed with dormitory construction funds. 
Home Management Duplex B became the Genevieve Fisher House in 1957. 
In 1962 the east portion retained that name but the west portion was renamed the Paulena Nickell House. This continued the recognition of Miss Nickell when the buil~ing formerly carrying her name was changed 
to Child Development Building. 
When the College of Education became a separate entity in 1968 the Nickell-Fisher House became its headquarters and continued in that use until 1976. Since then the house has served as student living quarters.
