An appropriation in the spring of 1927 provided funds for an Insec tary building. The function was explained in the April 16, 1927, issue of the Iowa State Student: 
An entomology building will be used for studying the insect 
pests which are already in Iowa, as well as insects which may 
harm Iowa farmers in the near future such as the corn borer. 
The building was more completely described the following month: 
According to present plans, the main building is a two-story brick construction about a hundred feet long. At one end will be a 70-foot greenhouse where plants will be grown for the pur pose of studying insects injurious to them. On one side will be a screened-in house about 100 feet long for the purpose of raising insect specimens for study, and near this will be a cave for studying the life of underground insects. 
The building will be used entirely for research work and will contain laboratories with equipment for studying insects and for handling insecticides. A few offices may be  moved to the new building but no classes will be held in it.(1) 
Construction of the building started in September 1927 and it was completed the following spring. 
An addition providing more laboratory and office space was made to the east end of the building in 1967-69. That project was partially funded by a grant from the Cooperative State Research Service of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
