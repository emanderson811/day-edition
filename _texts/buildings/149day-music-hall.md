This was the second "Professor's House" erected on the campus. It was first occupied in 1870 by Professor George W. Jones, mathematics, who also served as college cashier. In that same year Edgar W. Stanton entered the college and lived with the Jones family. From 1874 through 1878 the house was the residence of General Geddes and Stanton retained his room there. From 1879 until his death in 1920 this building was 
the Stanton home. 
In 1899 the ISC Student reported that "Prof. Stanton's residence is being remodeled and enlarged."(1) That enlargement consisted prin cipally of a twenty foot extension to the east, giving the house an entirely new front appearance. Repairs costing about $680 were made in 1904.(2) In 1914 the house was connected to the central heating 
system and the old coal room in the basement was converted to a garage with an entrance drive from the south. 
Mrs. Stanton continued to live in the house after her husband's death, and in 1922 she started the tea room in "the Maples" as the house 
then became known.(3) She moved to Osborn Cottage in 1924, but the 
tea room continued operation under a faculty organization with the 
food service provided by the Home Economics department. 
In 1926 the front (east) porch was enclosed, the kitchen was enlarged and more equipment was installed.(4) The tea room continued in opera tion until 1928 when the Memorial Union opened and began operation of 
its food service.

After minor remodeling to the building the Music Department moved into it in November 1928.(1) 
The new name "Music Hall" was formally applied to the building by action of the Board on March 7, 192 9. 
The building continued as the home of the Music Department until the summer of 1978 when it was razed to make way for a new music building.
