At its meeting of November 21, 1902, the Board of Trustees allocated money from the special building tax fund for "erecting a judging pavilion for Agronomy and Animal Husbandry sixty feet in diameter, two stories and veneered with pressed brick." 
Construction contract was awarded in March 1903, and the building was described: "This will be of buff brick, two stories high and octagonal shape. The first floor will be occupied by the department of Animal Husbandry and the second by the Agronomy department." (1) In the next issue of the paper the added information was given that "there will be

three elevated rows of seats extending entirely around the room." 
At the time of his resignation in 1910, President Storms said: "This building, thoroughly equipped in every way is conceded to be the best building of its kind on the continent."(!) 
In 1911 it was connected to the central heating system. 
The building was razed in 1972 to make room for the new Physical Plant Shops and Central Stores Building.
