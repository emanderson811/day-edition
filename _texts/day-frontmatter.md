## Acknowledgements

I am grateful for the cooperation given me by the University Admini­stration in the compilation of this history. Although the gathering of notes and reference material has extended over a twelve-year period, the actual writing of the manuscript has been possible only during the last two years before retirement from the university staff. During those two years I have been able to spend the major part of my time putting the work into its final form. 

Everett Swagert, University Architect, in whose office I have continued to headquarter, has been especially considerate in limiting the re­sponsibilities assigned to me in order that I could complete this his­tory.

Encouragement to undertake and finish the work has come from a number of people who have expressed sincere interest in the pro;ect. Carl Hamilton, Vice President for Information and Development, has been especially helpful with suggestions for editorial arrangement. Toby Fishbein, University Archivist, has been an enthusiastic supporter of 
the project and has helped in locating source materials. 

A number of people have assisted in clarifying questionable points. Older faculty and staff members who have been on the campus for many years have helped in separating speculation from facts. However, it 
is essential to recognize that memories may not always be as accurate 
as one would like.

The efforts and patience of several office secretaries is appreciated and acknowledged. Typing the excerpts from the long-hand original Board Minutes was often a difficult task. And for the typists of the later material and that in the student papers it was often a monotonous chore. 

To my wife, Betty Vinje Day, I give special thinks for reading of the manuscript, for her suggestions for improvement in writing, and for 
assistance in proofreading. 

The maps reproduced in the volume were drawn in their final form by Vanitha Venugopal, a student in Community and Regional Planning.
