## ANIMAL HUSBANDRY RESEARCH (or EXPERIMENTAL) LABORATORY 
This building is known only from its inclusion in the list of build­ings in the annual financial reports where it appears between 1918 and 1924 with a valuation of $1625. In the 1928 report the building appears with a value of $1600 on the Animal Husbandry Farm, and con­tinues at that figure through 1966. It was razed when the site was developed for the Iowa State Center. Where it was originally located on the campus ha~ not been determined. 

## ARCHERY HUT 
This was a small structure, only 8 x 12 feet, erected on the west side of the men's play field in 1938. That would be at a location just north of the parking lot on the west side of Beyer Hall. The $100 building was razed in 1957. 

## BARN -Jones 
Only one reference has been found to this building. In the January 1870 Minutes it is referred to as "a rough structure stands near Prof. Jones house and is now used as a Carpenter Shop." (The Jones House is the building known since 1929 as Music Hall.) 
The 1883 map shows a small building about 80 feet west and slightly 
south of the house. It does not appear on later maps. However, the 
maps may not always have depicted minor sheds and out-buildings. 

## BARN -Geddes 
At its meeting in November 1877 the Board appropriated the sum of $64.00 "to reimburse Gen . .J.L. Geddes for investment of that amount in build­ing a barn." 
Where that structure was located has not been determined, but it was probably somewhere in the area that had been allocated for the Steward's use. 
In December 1894 the Board recommended "that the barn of the stewar<l 
be removed farther east oh the road as soon as building funds can be 
arranged." 
No other references have been found. 

## BARN -at the Knoll 
This barn was built in 1900 for the use of the President at the Knoll. 
In 1914 the Iowa State Student reported that "the men working on the dormitories are sleeping in President Pearson's barn and do their 
cooking near the creek west of the Knoll." 
The following year the barn was moved to the poultry farm. 

## BARN -Grounds Department 
This barn was located south west of Marston Cottage as shown on a 1909 map, but not on one dated 1905. When it was built is not re­corded. Repairs were made to it in 1909. 
No specific date of its removal can be found. It is identified on a 1921 map but is not shown on a map of 1925. 

## BUNK HOUSE 
This small structure is included in the building lists from 1940 to 1968 in which year it was written off. It is probable that it had been razed some years before that date, however, because there has been no recollection of the structure by any of the oldest employees of the Physical Plant department. 
The reports show a valuation of $100, unchanged throughout the years. The later financial reports indicate that the building dates from 1932. 

## CADDY HOUSE 
Located near the Club House this 12 x 21 feet structure saw use from 
1938 until the change in the golf course eliminated the fairways south 
of the Northwestern tracks. It was razed in 1973. It was valued at 
$258. 

## CATTLE SHED (Cooking Shed) 
The only reference to this structure is found in the Minutes of 
October 1911 where it was stated that 
The sum of $200.00 is appropriated from Repair and Contingent 
Fund for fireproof cooking shed to be built nort.h of large cattle 
barn. 
It appears, but unidentified, on a 1915 map. On a 1921 map it is 
called Cattle Shed. It is found, without a name, on a 1923 map, but 
is not shown on a 1926 map, so it was evidently removed between those 
two dates. 

## CENTRAL STORES STOR~GE 
Two buildings, each 20 x 74 feet, were built in 1944, north of what was then Central Stores Building. They were razed in 1972 to make space for the north wing of the new Physical Plant Shops and Central Stores Building. 
464 

## CHEMICAL STORAGE BUILDINGS (2) 
Two buildings, each 20 by 74 feet, were located north of what was 
then the Chemistry Building. The west ends of the two were on line with the west side of that building. They first appeared on the building list in the Financial Report in 1944 and remained with a constant value of $1500 each through 1964. They were removed before 
the wing was added to the Chemistry Building (Gilman Hall). 

## CLUB HOUSE 
This building served the players at the Veenker Golf Course from 1938 until the course was revised in the early seventies when the two fair­ways on the south side of the Northwestern tracks were eliminated. It was located about midway between .the Communications Building and the Cemetery, a short distance north of Pammel Road. It carried a valua­tion of $1800. It was razed in 1973. 

## EXPERIMENT STATION MACHINE SHED Implement Shed (Dept. of Farm Mechanics) 
This building, built in 1904,(1) was located just northeast of the Experiment Station Barn and due north of the westernmost of the two octagonal brick judging pavilions (now about the southwest corner of the present Physical Plant Shops and Central Stores Building). In 1911 it was repaired and a 16 foot addition made to it.(2) It is shown on a 1921 map but is not found on a 1925 map, so had apparently been moved or razed by that time. 

## FIELD SHED (Horticulture Barn; Machine Shed) 
This small building stood a short distance east of the Horticulture Barn (later Child Nursery). It was first included in the building list in 1908, and on a map dated 1909. On some later maps it is identi­fied by the term Horticultural Barns, used for the two buildings. On the 1921 map it is called Machine Shed. It was last included on a building list in 1924 with a valuation of $250. It was probably re­moved shortly before the Bevier House was moved to about the same lo­cation in 1925.

(2) Minutes, June 1911 

## FOUNDRY STORE HOUSE 
All that is known apout this building is its inclusion on building lists between 1899 and 1906. The 1899 entry shows it with a value of $100. In 1906 the value is only $75. No map has been found dating from that period and the location of the building cannot be deter­mined, but it was probably close to what was then the Foundry(later known as Building A). 

## FRUIT HOUSE 
Built: 1888 Plans by Professor of Horticulture (,J .L. Budd). Location not determined. Not shown on any maps. 
This building was authorized in May 1888.(1) Its cost of $600 was recorded in the Biennial Report for 1888-89. 
When the new greenhouses were being built in 1896 it was decided that "we omit the potting house, using therefore the present frame fruit storage house belonging to Horticultural Dept. standing northeast of Agricultural Hall." (2) • 
No record has been found as to razing or removal of this building, unless it be the structure referred to in the November 14, 1910 issue of the ISC Student. See that item under Insectary (First). 

## GARAGES 
As automobiles came into use the need ~or garages also became important. Records on those built on the campus are meager, 
Kildee Cottage: Cessna was granted permission to build a 10' x 16' 
garage there in 1913. Five years later permission was given to Scheman 
to build a garage. Whether the first one was never built, in disre­
pair, or gone is not recorded. 
Coburn House: In 1914 Knapp was granted permission to build a 12' x 
20' garage about 30' northeast of his house. 
Knoll: A garage was built there in 1919. 
Curtiss: A small structure south of the Machine Shed is identified 
as the Curtiss garage on the 1921 map.

Minutes, June -July 1896 

Lodges: In 1931 or 1932 a garage was erected north of the Oak-Elm Lodges and lasted until 1938 or '39. 
10-Car: This large structure was built in 1933, to the north of the Central Stores Building. It was first used to house Physical Plant vehicles, but in later years it served as a storage place for building materials and other supplies stocked by Central Stores. It was razed in 1972 to make room for the Physical Plant Shops building. 

## GENETICS CHICK ISOLATION 
Built: 1948-49 
Contractor: Ringland-Johnson, Inc. 
This relatively small building, about 70 x 30 feet, was built for 
"studies....on the effect of inheritance of the chicken on its resis­
tance to diseases to which it has been subjected."(l) 
Construction started in November 1948 and was completed the following 
August. (2) 
In 1979 it is being used for growing birds --primarily for doves, 
but also some pigeons. 

## GENETICS POULTRY LABORATORY 
Built: 1933 
Architect: Henry Geise, Prof. of Agric. Engineering 
Contractor: Building and Grounds Dept. 
This small building was erected in the latter weeks of .1933. The 
Iowa State Student of Nov. 25, 1933, said it " ....will be just north 
of the Genetics Building which was erected last fall. It will be of 
tile construction, 24 feet by 42.feet in size." 

## GENETICS STORAGE BUIIDING (Genetics Shavings Storage) 
Built: 1961 
This small metal faced building is first recorded in the Financial 
Report for 1961 with a valuation of $2500. It replaced an earlier 
frame structure which was known as Driver's Training Storage, and 
which was razed that same year. 
(1) Iowa State Daily, November 10, 1948 
(2) Minutes, September 13, 1949 

## HOSE HOUSE 
The earliest mention of a building to house fire fighting equipment was in April 1899. The ISC Student of April 25 reported: "The hose, hook and ladder building for the college fire department is now com­plete." 
That construction was recorded in the Minutes of June 1899: "Com­petitive bids were received on building for truck and hose-cart, and a building covered with corrigated (sic)iron has been erected at a cost of $166.33." 
The Iowa State Student, on February 7, 1923, records that "in the little shed behind the book store are two fire trucks which have not been used for some time. One is a small hook and ladder truck, the other a hose cart." 
A 1921 map identifies a small structure north of the Hub as Hose House and it also appears there, without identification, on a 1925 map. 
It is first included on a building list in 1899 with a value of $175. 
In 1903 its value is $400. The last entry occurs in 1928 where the 
value is down to $150. The exact date of its removal has not been 
determined. 

## ICE HOUSE -COLLEGE 
The Farm Superintendent's report for 1869, recorded in the Board Min­
utes of January 1870 stated: "A temporary ice house was erected for 
the College and 2500 cubic feet of ice securely stored in it." Re­
pairs were made in 1873. 
In 1875 discussion of more repairs was held but instead an appropria­
tion of $100 was made for building a new College Ice House. (1) The 
following March $235 was appropriated "for the purpose of completing 
and painting the College Ice House." This was still an insufficient 
amount, as in August 1876 an additional $29.05 was appropriated. 
The Ice House is shown alongside the Coal House across the road west 
of the north wing of Main. 
At the June 1892 meeting the Board adopted a resolution "That the 
Faculty Committee on Public Grounds be instructed .... to remove the 
garbage house and ice house at the rear of Mairi building to some more 
obscure location. 
(1) Minutes, November 1875 Later that year the Board approved a bill of "$12.72 for taking down and moving debris of ice house."(l) 

## ICE HOUSE -CREAMERY 
An ice house was built in 1883 in conjunction with the First Creamery. By 1889 it was reported that the ice house (as well as other buildings) was badly in need of repairs. A new ice house was provided as an ad­junct to the new Creamery when it was erected in 1892. 

## ICE HOUSE -EXPERIMENT STATION 
The only references to this Ice House occur in 1896 when a motion 
carried at the June 30 -July 2 meeting "that Mr. Sexton be granted 
the use of the old ice house back of the present budding house." In 
November an $8.00 payment "for moving old ice house to its new lqca­
tion near house occupied by Jerry Sexton" was not allowed. 

## INTRAMURAL HUT 
A 12 x 21 feet building was sid.e of the men's playing fiwas valued at $250.  erected eld in 1940.  near  the Archery Hut It was razed in 1957.  on  the west It  

## ISOLATION BARN  
The Minutes for April 13, 1920, record that "President Pearson dis­cussed the need of an animal quarantine shed, and he requested that such a building be constructed near the new cattle barn and north of the meat laboratory, at an estimated cost of $1000.00." 
The 1921 map shows the Isolation Barn at a site about at the north­east corner of what is now the Seed Science Building. This is the approximate location of the Hog Barn and Pavilion which was started 
in September 1921. Therefore, the Isolation Barn was either razed or relocated before that date. It may have been taken to the Animal Husbandry Farm because in 1934 the recommendation was made for im­provements to the Animal Husbandry Isolation Barn for $2000.(2) 

## LAUNDRY STORAGE 
This 20 x 50 feet building was erected in 1944 at the northeast corner of the Electric and Paint Shop and was razed in 1958. It carried a 
(1) Minutes, November -December 1892 
(2) Minutes, .January 23, 1934 valuation of $1000 over the period of its existence. It originally served as an adjunct to the Laundry Building (Electric and Paint Shop), but later was used for other storage. 

## LOCOMOTIVE SHEDS 
In July 1900 the Chicago and North Western Rail Road presented a loco­motive to the College. In September Professor Bissell was authorized to build a protective house for it, not to exceed $500 in cost.(1) 
The September 10, 1900, issue of the ISC Student records that "A building 20 x 60 is being built over the college locomotive which stands just west of the carpenter shop." That places it in what is now the right-of-way of Riggs Court, just east of the end of the north wing of the Naval Armory. 
Late in 1904 another locomotive, the engine "Iowa", was presented to the college and the following April a shed was built over it.(2) 
A 1906 campus map shows a locomotive shed in the location described above. Presumably that would be the one built the year before, but what became of the 1900-shed cannot be determined. There is no record of when the 1905 shed was razed, but by 1921 the locomotive, without a shed, had been relocated to the northeast of its original location. 

## MACHINE SHED (Granary) 
This structure is known only from its occurrence on maps as no refer­ences have been found elsewhere. It was located a short distance to the west of the first Cattle Barn (Farm Barn) on a north-south axis. It appears to have been about 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. It first is seen on an 1887 map, but without identification; an 1894 map calls it a Granary; on the 1921 map and building list it is Machine Shed. It is included on a map dated 1925 but is unidentified by name. A 1928 map does not show it, so it was removed between those last two dates. 

## QUARANTINE HOSPITAL (Hospital Annex; Isolation House) 
The first appearance of this structure is on a map dated 1909, where 
it is found a short distance west of what is now the Laboratory of 
Mechanics, b4t it is not given any identification on that map. In 
the October 21, 1913, copy of the ISC Student there is this report: 
(1) 
Minutes, September 1900 

(2) 
Minutes, December 1904 and April 1905 

The old carpenter shop is being completely renovated and will 
soon be known as the pest house. Four rooms with all modern 
conveniences will take care of the overcrowded hospital. Con­
tagious diseases will be banished there, and this will be a 
great relief to present conditions. This house will be used 
temporarily until the new hospital is built. 
In January 1914 the paper records that this "emergency hospital" was connected with the steam heating plant. 
A 1915 map identifies this as "Hospital Annex", while the 1921 map calls it "Isolation House". It is included on building lists from 1914 through 1920 at a value of $1000 but is omitted from the 1922 list so apparently was removed between 1920 and 1922. 

## RABBIT HUTCH 
"A $2000 rabbit hutch is to be erected for Professor C. Lloyd Jones. It will be located just south of the horse barn," reported the Iowa State Student on Oct. 21, 1916. On December 7 the paper mentioned it among buildings "now erecting or will soon start." It appears on the 1921 map in a locati-0n at about the center of what is today the north side of Dairy Industries. It did not appear on building lists and there is no record of when it was moved or razed. 

## SLAUGHTER HOUSE 
No record can be found to determine when the Slaughter House was built, although it was probably an adjunct to the Piggery. In 1879 the Farm Superintendent was directed "to remove the Slaughter House from its present location to such place near the mouth of the new sewer as he may deem most suitable."(1) 
The Aurora, August 1880 refers to a slaughter house as one of the im­provements to be noted. In November of that year the Board appropriated $73.65 for repair of slaughter house. 
In 1891 Prof. Wilson was authorized to tear down the building "and 
use the lumber in repair of fences and farm buildings."(2)

Minutes, May 1891 

## SORGHUM WORKS 
Very little can be found about this building. In the 10th Biennial Report (1882-83) a list of farm buildings includes "the sorghum works, also supplied with steam power." The October 1889 issue of The Aurora records: "The sugar factory was shut down for the year. The directors are not fully satisfied as to its being a success. Experiments will be carried farther next year." 
By 1892 the building was ordered removed. The minutes for September 27-29 record that the Board "Moved that the Committee on Public Grounds and Railroad be directed to investigate the building erected by the Sugar Refining Co., and prevail upon the company if possible to settle up its affairs and remove its property from the college grounds." Carried. 
Two months later the committee reported that the promise has been re­
ceived that the building would be removed. 
The location of the building has not been determined. The fact 
that it had steam power would indicate that it was probably in the 
area of the shops or possibly a lean-to on that building. It is not 
identified on either an 1883 or 1887 map, the only two extant con­
temporary maps of the campus. 

## STORAGE BUILDING 7 -10 
This warehouse type building was constructed in the fall of 1947. 
From then until about 1969 it was used for storage by the Atomic Re­
search Institute. Subsequently it was turned back to the university 
and has been used for miscellaneous storage since that time. The two 
easternmost units were sold and removed in 1977. The other sections 
were razed in 1979. The structure stood just a short distance east 
of the Printing Services and Distribution Building. 

## TILE STORAGE SHED (Incinerator) 
The need for a college incinerator was first recorded in the Board Minutes of July 1, 1930 when it was referred to Dr. Knapp "for in­vestigation, consideration and report." The following year, in Octo­ber, the Board approved an expenditure of $1,500 for the Incinerator.(1) 
It was built in 1932 and was first carried on the Financial Report at a value of $2096, in 1934 
(1) Minutes, October 7, 1931 
472 
A fire of unknown origin destroyed the roof in 1937.(1) 
When the use of the structure as an incinerator was discontinued has not been learned. 
From 1968 through 1970 the structure was identified as "Tile Storage Shed", but in other years it has been listed as "Incinerator". In 1976 it was transferred from Service Area classification to the College of Engineering lists and is still carried with the original valuation. 

## TOOL HOUSE (Implement Shed) 
The 1st Annual Report (1858-59) includes a tool-house as one of the 
necessities for developing the college farm. In 1865 a committee 
recommended "the building of a tool house for the safe keeping and 
preservation of the farm implements and tools."(2) Again in .Tanuary 
1868 such a building was in the list of needs. 
Between that year and 1878 a tool house was built since the November 
1878 minutes record funding of $60 "for the purpose of moving the old 
tool house and fitting it up as a tool and coal house in connection with the Horticulture Lab_qratory. 11 
The only other record came in 1894 when the Board adopted a recommenda­tion "that Prof. Budd be requested to remove the old tool house to some place designated by Public Grounds Committee of the Faculty, or to tear down the same and remove the old material." (3) 

## WOOD SHED at SOUTH HALL 
Funds for a "wood-house" on the east side of the President's house were appropriated at the November 1873 meeting of the Board. The following May painting of the shed was authorized indicating that it had been erected between those two dates. 
This shed was close to the east end of South Hall. What became of it 
is not recorded. However, in July 1890 an allocation of $350 was made 
to build a "wood-house and store-room for the Domestic Economy depart­
ment."(4) This would indicate that the original shed was no longer 
existing at that time.
